SDHB-mutated PPGL display a hypermethylator phenotype associated with hallmarks of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study, we report the characterization of a unique model of Sdhb knockout in mouse chromaffin cells. Sdhb deficient cells exhibit a metastatic phenotype as highlighted by increased individual cell migration (characterized by faster motility and increased persistence) as well as high invasive and adhesion abilities. This phenotype is associated with the modulation of Twist1, Twist2, Tcf3, Snai1, N-cadherin or Krt19 expression, reflecting an EMT-like reprogramming of cells. Krt19 is epigenetically silenced in Sdhb-deficient cells and re-expressed after treatment by the demethylating agent decitabine. Krt19 rescue by lentiviral transduction in Sdhb-deficient cells and Krt19 inhibition by RNA interference in wild-type cells were performed. Both studies revealed the involvement of KRT19 in the invasive phenotype by modulating collective and individual migration and cell/extra-cellular matrix adhesion properties. These findings underline the role of hypermethylation and EMT in the in vitro acquisition of metastatic properties, following SDHB loss of function.'>, <RefJournal 'oncotarget' p32955 issn:1949-2553 issue:32 volume:6>, <Ref doi '10.18632/oncotarget.5106'>}\n",

This structure is defined onto easily adapt the level of details (LOD) of each subpart (cell) of the vegetation element. During the rendering process, we determine a global level of details for each block of vegetation. Then, we refine it for each cell according to the following heuristic: leaves or branches on the rear of tree or inside the forest are statistically less visible than front ones and then can be rendered coarsely. As a result, our method greatly decrease the number of rendered primitives by preserving realism.

Briefly, is it possible to determine automatically if two images are similar or not? The two stages detailed in the article are the matching of two images and the clustering of a set of images. Matching consists of finding the common features of two images while no information is known about the image contents, the motion, or the calibration of the camera.

Using observations from medical images (CT scans), we build a spatial model consisting in a set of non-linear partial differential equations. After calibration of its parameters with clinical data, this model reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the spatial tumour evolution of one specific patient. Important features of the growth such as the appearance of spatial heterogeneities and the therapeutical failures may be explained by our model. We then investigate numerically the possibility of optimizing the treatment in terms of progression-free survival time and minimum tumour size reachable by varying the dose of the first treatment. We find that according to our model, the progression-free survival time reaches a plateau with respect to this dose. We also demonstrate numerically that the spatial structure of the tumour may provide much more insights on the cancer cell activities than the standard RECIST criteria, which only consists in the measurement of the tumour diameter. Finally, we discuss on the non-predictivity of the model using only CT scans, in the sense that the early behaviour of the lesion is not sufficient to predict the response to the treatment.'>}\n"

We use it to produce Shadoo, a protein belonging to the prion family. A chromatographic method for the purification of (His)6-tagged recombinant Shadoo expressed as inclusion bodies is described. The inclusion bodies are solubilized in 8 M urea and bound to a Ni(2+)-charged column to perform ion affinity chromatography. Bound proteins are eluted by a gradient of imidazole. Fractions containing Shadoo protein are subjected to size exclusion chromatography to obtain a highly purified protein. In the final step purified Shadoo is desalted to remove salts, urea and imidazole. Recombinant Shadoo protein is an important reagent for biophysical and biochemical studies of protein conformation disorders occurring in prion diseases. Many reports demonstrated that prion neurodegenerative diseases originate from the deposition of stable, ordered amyloid fibrils. Sample protocols describing how to fibrillate Shadoo into amyloid fibrils at acidic and neutral/basic pHs are presented. The methods on how to produce and fibrillate Shadoo can facilitate research in laboratories working on prion diseases, since it allows for production of large amounts of protein in a rapid and low cost manner.'>, <Ref doi '10.3791/53432'>, <Ref pubmed '26709825'>}\n",

Sociologues et politologues se sont emparés de ces thématiques aiguisées par l’effondrement des régimes communistes en Russie et en Europe de l’Est, par les tensions entre constructions nationales et mondialisation, et par la relecture de l’expérience coloniale. Façonné par la quête des origines et l’interprétation sélective des temps longs de l’histoire, le monde présent porte aussi l’empreinte des tragédies du siècle dernier : nazisme et shoah, partitions et massacres, guerres et apartheid. Pouvoirs établis, mouvements contestataires ou collectivités dominées, les acteurs multiplient les usages de la mémoire pour stimuler les mobilisations contemporaines, ou restent prisonniers d’un « passé qui ne passe pas ». Ce premier colloque des instituts français de recherche à l’étranger donne la parole, sur ce thème des actives présences du passé, à quelques vingt-cinq chercheurs venus de treize instituts établis en Europe, en Asie, en Amérique latine et en Afrique.

Along the west coast of southern Africa, a multivariate analysis of the zonal flow of moisture computed from NCEP-DOE AMIP II Re-analyses reveals a primary mode of variability typical of variations in intensity and of the latitudinal migration of the circulation associated with the midlatitude westerlies and the South Atlantic anticyclone. In austral summer (January–February), this mode, referred to as the South Atlantic midlatitude mode, is found to be well correlated with rainfall over southern Africa (i.e. to the south of the upper lands surrounding the Congo basin). Its positive/negative phases are found to correspond with surface pressures changes over the South Atlantic region in austral summer when the South Atlantic anticyclone is shifted northward/southward respectively. Such changes are accompanied by dipole-like SST anomalies in the midlatitude South Atlantic Ocean, while simultaneous SST anomalies with a similar structure are also found over South Indian Ocean regions. In January–February, positive/negative events linked to the South Atlantic midlatitude mode are marked by meridional shifts (northward/southward) and weakening/strengthening of the ITCZ over the southern tropics, together with modulations in intensity (weakened/sustained) of the Angola low, which could act as a tropical source of moisture for Tropical Temperate Troughs (TTTs). In association with a strengthened/weakened zonal component of the southern extension of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ), this could modulate the meridional transfer of moisture south of 15°S to the advantage/detriment of Angolan coastal regions, where above/below rainfall are expected. Variations in the latitudinal position (northward/southward) of the South Atlantic anticyclone, and thus of the midlatitude westerlies, are also found to reduce/favour moisture advection towards southern Africa subtropics allowing the southern Indian trades to penetrate less/more over the subcontinent south of 25°S. This would create a situation where convection processes are inhibited/supported within the SICZ/TTTs region resulting in drier/wetter conditions locally for positive/negative events respectively.'>, <Ref doi '10.1007/s00382-008-0377-7'>}\n"

The same participants needed to recognize the emotion displayed by the top half of an upright or upside-down face that was or was not aligned with a bottom half that displayed another emotion. The results showed that the ability to recognize facial emotion develops with age, with a developmental course that depends on the emotion to be recognized.

The erection of P. arctica is mainly supported by molecular data, since the species shares identical ultrastructure with another species in the complex, P. fryxelliana, and represents a new case of crypticity within the genus. Despite their morphological similarity, the two species are not closely related in phylogenies based on LSU, ITS and rbcL. Interestingly, P. arctica is phylogenetically most closely related to P. granii and P. subcurvata, from which the species is, however, morphologically different. P. granii and P. subcurvata lack the central larger interspace which is one of the defining features of the P. pseudodelicatissima complex. The close genetic relationship between P. arctica and the two species P. granii and P. subcurvata is demonstrated by analysis of the secondary structure of ITS2 which revealed no compensatory base changes, two hemi-compensatory base changes, and two deletions in P. arctica with respect to the other two species. These findings emphasize that rates of morphological differentiation, molecular evolution and speciation are often incongruent for Pseudo-nitzschia species, resulting in a restricted phylogenetic value for taxonomic characters used to discriminate species. The description of a new cryptic species, widely distributed in the Arctic and potentially representing an endemic component of the Arctic diatom flora, reinforces the idea of the existence of noncosmopolitan Pseudo-nitzschia species and highlights the need for combined morphological and molecular analyses to assess the distributional patterns of phytoplankton species.'>}\n",

This phenomenon has attracted attention since the discovery that even low environmental doses of exogenous steroids can adversely affect gonad morphology (ovotestis development) and induce reproductive failure. Modern genomic-based technologies have enhanced opportunities to find out mechanisms of actions (MOA) and identify biomarkers related to the toxic action of a compound. However, high throughput data interpretation relies on statistical analysis, species genomic resources, and bioinformatics tools. The goals of this study are to improve the knowledge of feminisation in fish, by the analysis of molecular responses in the gonads of rainbow trout fry after chronic exposure to several doses (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/L) of ethynylestradiol (EE2) and to offer target genes as potential biomarkers of ovotestis development. We successfully adapted a bioinformatics microarray analysis workflow elaborated on human data to a toxicogenomic study using rainbow trout, a fish species lacking accurate functional annotation and genomic resources. The workflow allowed to obtain lists of genes supposed to be enriched in true positive differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were subjected to over-representation analysis methods (ORA). Several pathways and ontologies, mostly related to cell division and metabolism, sexual reproduction and steroid production, were found significantly enriched in our analyses. Moreover, two sets of potential ovotestis biomarkers were selected using several criteria. The first group displayed specific potential biomarkers belonging to pathways/ontologies highlighted in the experiment. Among them, the early ovarian differentiation gene foxl2a was overexpressed. The second group, which was highly sensitive but not specific, included the DEGs presenting the highest fold change and lowest p-value of the statistical workflow output. The methodology can be generalized to other (non-model) species and various types of microarray platforms.'>}\n",

In this study, we compare two dispersal strategies among Aphidiinae parasitoids: eggs and larvae dispersal through winged aphid flight and active dispersal by adult parasitoids. Using a molecular method applied to a sample of >2,000 winged migratory aphids captured in a suction trap situated in Western France, we assessed the proportion of winged aphids carrying an aphidiine larva. In the six most abundant aphid species, we found an average parasitism rate of migrating aphids close to 1% and identified seven different, mainly generalist, parasitoid species. We also identified the species and the sex of adult Aphidiinae captured by the suction trap based on morphological criteria. We found that dispersing adult parasitoids were almost exclusively female. Parasitoid dispersal strategy seems to be species-dependant but this result needs to be confirmed by an exhaustive analysis of winged aphids captured. We discuss the possible impact of the low parasitism rate of winged aphids on parasitoid population dynamics and the importance of these results in the context of biological control and of the study of food webs between aphids and their natural enemies.\">, <Ref doi '10.1603/EN14114'>}\n",

In the so-called Isparta Angle, the magmatism is contemporaneous with the Aegean extensional regime initiated during the Late Miocene and active throughout the Pliocene and Quaternary. The Gölcük volcano-forming stages consist of three main eruptive cycles: Cycle I comprising 200 m-thick pyroclastic flow deposits; Cycle II consisting of tephriphonolitic lava dome-flows extruded throughout the caldera; and Cycle III characterized by tuff-ring deposits related to the last phreatoplinian events. These late explosive events sampled plutonic xenoliths that allow to better constrain magma fractionation processes that operated at depth in the magma chamber. Magma evolution was first controlled by accumulation of clinopyroxene, phlogopite and apatite, then by phlogopite, amphibole and feldspars, with apatite, magnetite, titanite and zircon as accessories. Crystallization of clinopyroxene, phlogopite and amphibole probably controlled the silica-saturation trend of the whole series and faithfully reflect intensive H2O variations in the magma that were responsible of explosive cyclic events. The parental magma may have had a lamprophyric-tephritic composition. Trace element and isotope ratios indicate a prevalent asthenospheric source versus lithospheric one. Geochemical features, such as strong enrichment of LILE, REE, HFSE in the Gölcük magma point to the involvement of a asthenospheric OIB-type melt with a possible carbonatitic component, that interacted with remnants of the delaminated lithosphere during upwelling.'>}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract \"Ovococci form a morphological group that includes several human pathogens (enterococci and streptococci). Their shape results from two modes of cell wall insertion, one allowing division and one allowing elongation. Both cell wall synthesis modes rely on a single cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ. Despite the central role of FtsZ in ovococci, a detailed view of the in vivo nanostructure of ovococcal Z-rings has been lacking thus far, limiting our understanding of their assembly and architecture. We have developed the use of photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) in the ovococcus human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae by engineering spDendra2, a photoconvertible fluorescent protein optimized for this bacterium. Labeling of endogenously expressed FtsZ with spDendra2 revealed the remodeling of the Z-ring's morphology during the division cycle at the nanoscale level. We show that changes in the ring's axial thickness and in the clustering propensity of FtsZ correlate with the advancement of the cell cycle. In addition, we observe double-ring substructures suggestive of short-lived intermediates that may form upon initiation of septal cell wall synthesis. These data are integrated into a model describing the architecture and the remodeling of the Z-ring during the cell cycle of ovococci. The Gram-positive human pathogen S. pneumoniae is responsible for 1.6 million deaths per year worldwide and is increasingly resistant to various antibiotics. FtsZ is a cytoskeletal protein polymerizing at midcell into a ring-like structure called the Z-ring. FtsZ is a promising new antimicrobial target, as its inhibition leads to cell death. A precise view of the Z-ring architecture in vivo is essential to understand the mode of action of inhibitory drugs (see T. den Blaauwen, J. M. Andreu, and O. Monasterio, Bioorg Chem 55:27-38, 2014, doi:10.1016/j.bioorg.2014.03.007, for a review on FtsZ inhibitors). This is notably true in ovococcoid bacteria like S. pneumoniae, in which FtsZ is the only known cytoskeletal protein. We have used superresolution microscopy to obtain molecular details of the pneumococcus Z-ring that have so far been inaccessible with conventional microscopy. This study provides a nanoscale description of the Z-ring architecture and remodeling during the division of ovococci.\">, <Ref pubmed '26286692'>}\n",

If it has been analytically proven that communication can help stabilize traffic flow at a microscopic level, it is interesting to evaluate realistic communication strategies taking into consideration multiple perturbations such as sensors faults or driver cooperation. In this paper, a three-layer multi-agent framework is used to model and control the homogenization of traffic flow. The physical layer coordinates the vehicles dynamics based on a cooperative car following model.

In order to identify the bacterial factors involved in this chronicity, Newbould 305 (N305), a strain that can reproducibly induce mild and chronic mastitis in an experimental setting, was characterized in depth. We employed genomic and proteomic techniques combined with phenotype characterization, in order to comprehensively analyse N305. The results were compared with data obtained on S. aureus RF122, a strain representative of the major clone involved in severe bovine mastitis worldwide. Five mobile genetic elements were identified in the N305 genome as carrying virulence factors which correlated with phenotypic features such as cytotoxicity, mammary epithelial cell invasion or host-adaptation. In particular, the presence and characteristics of surface exposed proteins correlated well with the greater adhesion and internalization capacities of N305 in bovine mammary epithelial cells. N305 also displayed less diversity of toxin genes but secreted larger quantities of these toxins, associated with a higher cytotoxicity potential. Our data are consistent with the invasiveness and host-adaptation features which contribute to the chronicity of S. aureus mastitis. Mobile genetic elements, exoproteins and surface exposed proteins constitute good targets for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms related to mastitis chronicity.'>}\n",

Like all NMP kinases, UMP-CMP kinase binds the phosphodonor, usually ATP, and the NMP at different binding sites. The reaction results from an in-line phosphotransfer from the donor to the acceptor. The probe for the donor site was displaced by the bisubstrate analogs of the Ap5X series (where X = U, dT, A, G), indicating the broad specificity of the acceptor site. Both CMP and dCMP were competitors for the acceptor site probe. To find antimetabolites for antivirus and anticancer therapies, we have developed a method of screening acyclic phosphonate analogs that is based on the affinity of the acceptor-binding site of the human UMP-CMP kinase. Several uracil vinylphosphonate derivatives had affinities for human UMP-CMP kinase similar to those of dUMP and dCMP and better than that of cidofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities. The uracil derivatives were inhibitors rather than substrates of human UMP-CMP kinase. Also, the 5-halogen-substituted analogs inhibited the human TMP kinase less efficiently.

Interestingly, our heterozygous Men1 mutant mice exhibit not only the endocrine tumours commonly seen in MEN1 patients, but also Leydig cell tumours (LCT) with high frequency, accompanied systematically by loss of the wild-type Men1 allele. As there exists a similarity of tumour phenotype between these mice and those mutated for the components of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway belonging to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family, we investigated the expression and the activity of this pathway, known to have an important biological role in Leydig cells. Here, we report that the expression of AMH receptor type 2 is reduced in Men1 LCTs. Both immunostaining and western blot analyses also demonstrate a markedly decreased nuclear expression of Smad1, 3, 4 and 5 in the tumours. More interestingly, we show that the reconstituted menin expression in Men1-deficient Leydig cells derived from LCTs can significantly increase the transcriptional activity of a BMP pathway target promoter, XVent2. Furthermore, we found that the expression of p18, p27 and cyclin dependant kinase 4 (Cdk4), targets of TGF-beta pathways, is altered in the Leydig cell lesions.

In optimal input design problem, analytical solution exists for few particular cases based on a relatively simple model. The approach proposed here may be used for a process based on a continuous model in the time domain, with two assumptions on the observability and the general structure of the model. The new proposed approach is to solve a model predictive control problem coupled with an on line process parameter estimation at each time using an observer. A dynamic parametric sensitivity model (derived from the process model) is also used on line to get the parametric sensitivity that has to be optimized. Both optimal input and estimated model parameter are therefore obtained on line. The case study presented here is a powder coating curing process where the main thermal parameter to identify influences the powder curing. First simulation results show here the efficiency of the approach in the control software (MPC@CB) developed under Matlab.'>}\n",

Its architecture is optimized for implementation of common cryptography tasks. The processor has 128-bit separated data and key registers, dedicated instruction set optimized for key generation and management, embedded cipher, and embedded random number generator. From an architectural point of view, the most important characteristic of the proposed crypto-processor is the physical separation of data and key registers and buses, insuring that confidential keys will never leave the system in clear. This way, the processor enables to separate protected and unprotected security zones easily and also achieve complete physical isolation of key management and data zones inside the single FPGA. The first version of the processor implemented in Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA device achieves the frequency of 160 MHz and it occupies 1343 configurable logic blocks and 21 embedded memory blocks.'>}\n",

The aim of this work was to assess the effect of NaCl at two concentrations on three invasive freshwater species, Elodea canadensis, Myriophyllum aquaticum and Ludwigia grandiflora, by examining morphological and physiological parameters and using metabolic profiling. The growth rate (biomass and stem length) was reduced for all species, whatever the salt treatment, but the response to salt differed between the three species, depending on the NaCl concentration. For E. canadensis, the physiological traits and metabolic profiles were only slightly modified in response to salt, whereas M. aquaticum and L. grandiflora showed great changes. In both of these species, root number, photosynthetic pigment content, amino acids and carbohydrate metabolism were affected by the salt treatments. Moreover, we are the first to report the salt-induced accumulation of compatible solutes in both species. Indeed, in response to NaCl, L. grandiflora mainly accumulated sucrose. The response of M. aquaticum was more complex, because it accumulated not only sucrose and myo-inositol whatever the level of salt stress, but also amino acids such as proline and GABA, but only at high NaCl concentrations. These responses are the metabolic responses typically found in terrestrial plants.'>}\n",

LAB and PAB have also been studied for their probiotic properties but little is still known about their individual and/or synergistic beneficial effects within dairy matrices. In the context of a rising incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, it has become crucial to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of bacteria ingested in large numbers via dairy products. We therefore selected different strains and combinations of technological LAB and PAB. We determined their immunomodulatory potential by IL-10 and IL-12 induction, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, on either single or mixed cultures, grown on laboratory medium or directly in milk. Milk was fermented with selected anti-inflammatory strains of LAB or PAB/LAB mixed cultures and the resulting bacterial fractions were also evaluated for these properties, together with starter viability and optimum technological aspects. The most promising fermented milks were evaluated in the context of TNBS- or DSS-induced colitis in mice. The improvement in inflammatory parameters evidenced an alleviation of colitis symptoms as a result of fermented milk consumption. This effect was clearly strain-dependent and modulated by growth within a fermented dairy product. These findings offer new tools and perspectives for the development of immunomodulatory fermented dairy products for targeted populations.'>}\n",

As polyploid species usually have multiple origins, one intriguing, yet largely underexplored, question is whether different mechanisms suppressing crossovers between homoeologs may coexist within the same polyphyletic species. We addressed this question using Brassica napus, a young polyphyletic allopolyploid species. We first analyzed the meiotic behavior of 363 allohaploids produced from 29 accessions, which represent a large part of B. napus genetic diversity. Two main clear-cut meiotic phenotypes were observed, encompassing a twofold difference in the number of univalents at metaphase I. We then sequenced two chloroplast intergenic regions to gain insight into the maternal origins of the same 29 accessions; only two plastid haplotypes were found, and these correlated with the dichotomy of meiotic phenotypes. Finally, we analyzed genetic diversity at the PrBn locus, which was shown to determine meiotic behavior in a segregating population of B. napus allohaploids. We observed that segregation of two alleles at PrBn could adequately explain a large part of the variation in meiotic behavior found among B. napus allohaploids. Overall, our results suggest that repeated polyploidy resulted in different levels of crossover suppression between homoeologs in B. napus allohaploids.'>}\n",

About 70% sporadic BCCs bear somatic mutations in the PATCHED1 tumor suppressor gene which encodes the receptor for the Sonic Hedgehog morphogen (SHH). PATCHED1 germinal mutations are associated with the dominant Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), a major hallmark of which is a high susceptibility to BCCs. Although the vast majority of sporadic BCCs arises exclusively in sun exposed skin areas, 40 to 50% BCCs from NBCCS patients develop in non photo-exposed skin. Since overwhelming evidences indicate that microenvironment may both be modified by- and influence the- epithelial tumor, we hypothesized that NBCCS fibroblasts could contribute to BCCs in NBCCS patients, notably those developing in non photo-exposed skin areas. The functional impact of NBCCS fibroblasts was then assessed in organotypic skin cultures with control keratinocytes. Onset of epidermal differentiation was delayed in the presence of primary NBCCS fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, keratinocyte proliferation was severely reduced and showed high levels of nuclear P53 in both organotypic skin cultures and in fibroblast-led conditioning experiments. However, in spite of increased levels of senescence associated β-galactosidase activity in keratinocytes cultured in the presence of medium conditioned by NBCCS fibroblasts, we failed to observe activation of P16 and P21 and then of bona fide features of senescence. Constitutive extinction of P53 in WT keratinocytes resulted in an invasive phenotype in the presence of NBCCS fibroblasts. Finally, we found that expression of SHH was limited to fibroblasts but was dependent on the presence of keratinocytes. Inhibition of SHH binding resulted in improved epidermal morphogenesis. Altogether, these data suggest that the repertoire of diffusible factors (including SHH) expressed by primary NBCCS fibroblasts generate a stress affecting keratinocytes behavior and epidermal homeostasis. Our findings suggest that defects in dermo/epidermal interactions could contribute to BCC susceptibility in NBCCS patients.'>, <Ref pubmed '26694869'>}\n",

Remarkably, transcripts from multiple clusters accumulate at Dot COM, which is often juxtaposed with Yb-bodies, the cytoplasmic processing centers for cluster transcripts. Genetic evidence suggests that the accumulation of precursor transcripts at Dot COM represents one of the most upstream events in the piRNA pathway.

Atomic force microscopy imaging showed that (i) for T <35 ° C MSM segregated in gel phase domains protruding above the fluid phase, (ii) the addition of 20 mol % cholesterol resulted in smaller and more elongated lophase domains than in equimolar MSM/DOPC membranes, (iii) the MSM/cholesterol-enrichedl o phase domains were less salient than the MSM gel phase domains.

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref fr_abstract 'Les recherches conduites depuis 1997 dans le bassin de Sarliève, au pied de l\\'oppidum de Gergovie (Puy-de-Dôme), visent à appréhender, dans une perspective systémique et interdisciplinaire, les interactions sociétés-milieux dans la longue durée, à l\\'échelle d\\'un bassin-versant de taille moyenne localisé dans une zone de première importance sur le plan historique. Trois axes de recherche ont été définis : * la caractérisation de l\\'évolution du milieu à l\\'échelle du bassin-versant dans ses différentes composantes biophysiques ; * la caractérisation de l\\'histoire de l\\'occupation du sol et de l\\'exploitation du milieu par les populations successives établies dans le bassin ; * la caractérisation de l\\'impact de la pression anthropique sur le milieu (couverture végétale, dynamiques hydrosédimentaires). Les résultats obtenus fournissent les éléments d\\'un modèle socio-environnemental qui renouvelle celui élaboré pour la Grande Limagne dans les années 1970-1980. Une succession de cycles agraires est clairement mise en évidence. Ceux-ci sont liés à des phases de forte pression humaine identifiées au Néolithique moyen, au Bronze ancien, au Bronze final, au premier âge du Fer, à La Tène finale, au Haut-Empire, au Moyen Âge et à l\\'époque moderne. Ces cycles sont étroitement corrélés avec l\\'évolution de la végétation et la dynamique sédimentaire, mais également avec les variations verticales du plan d\\'eau. Des phases de transgression particulièrement amples et contraignantes sont mises en évidence durant l\\'âge du Bronze et le Moyen Âge. Le bas niveau du paléolac durant le second âge du Fer et le Haut-Empire est, en revanche, propice à l\\'occupation des bordures et même du fond de la cuvette, qui est complètement asséchée grâce à un système de drainage aménagé aux environs du changement d\\'ère. Un seuil quantitatif très net est franchi dans la première moitié du iie s. av. J.-C., avec la forte densification de l\\'habitat dans tous les types d\\'unités physiques. Les données archéologiques et paléoenvironnementales traduisent la mise en valeur méthodique des sols les plus fertiles, dans un contexte de croissance économique et démographique continue qui coïncide avec l\\'apparition de vastes agglomérations interprétées comme des \" places centrales \" (agglomération de la Grande Borne à Aulnat, oppida de Corent à Veyre- Monton, Gergovie à La Roche-Blanche et Gondole au Cendre). Cette tendance se poursuit durant les deux premiers siècles de notre ère, avec la généralisation de l\\'agrosystème à l\\'ensemble du bassin, quels que soient les types de reliefs, dans le cadre de l\\'économie domaniale qui se développe à la suite de la fondation d\\'Augustonemetum, nouvelle capitale de la cité arverne. La fin de l\\'Antiquité et le haut Moyen Âge voient le retour du marais à la faveur d\\'un climat plus humide et, surtout, de profonds changements dans les modalités de gestion du milieu. Un véritable lac est attesté par les textes médiévaux et par l\\'iconographie moderne. Il est définitivement asséché au début du xviie s.'>}\n",

The involvement of peroxidases in lignification is supported by a wealth of literature data. In contrast, the role of laccases in this major plant process is less firmly established. The large number of plant laccases, which argues for a variety of functions in plant development, makes the identification of lignin-specific laccases a challenge. However, in the past decade, the development of new genetic technologies and tools has played a central role towards resolving this issue. In addition, the plant model, Arabidopsis thaliana, has recently provided novel insights about the occurrence of laccases involved in stem lignification. Information about lignin-related laccases is also available from other species, such as poplar, or other organs and tissues, such as seed coats.

One approach to lowering these costs is to produce crops with cell walls that are more susceptible to hydrolysis to reduce preprocessing and enzyme inputs. To deepen our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of lignocellulose recalcitrance, we have screened a mutagenized population of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon for improved saccharification with an industrial polysaccharide-degrading enzyme mixture. From an initial screen of 2,400 M2 plants, we selected 12 lines that showed heritable improvements in saccharification, mostly with no significant reduction in plant size or stem strength. Characterization of these putative mutants revealed a variety of alterations in cell-wall components. We have mapped the underlying genetic lesions responsible for increased saccharification using a deep sequencing approach, and here we report the mapping of one of the causal mutations to a narrow region in chromosome 2. The most likely candidate gene in this region encodes a GT61 glycosyltransferase, which has been implicated in arabinoxylan substitution. Our work shows that forward genetic screening provides a powerful route to identify factors that impact on lignocellulose digestibility, with implications for improving feedstock for cellulosic biofuel production.'>, <Ref pubmed '25246540'>, <RefJournal 'proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america' p14601 issn:1091-6490 issue:40 volume:111>}\n",

The TILLING collection consists of DNA isolated from 5530 different families. Phenotypes were reported and organized in a phenotypic tree that is freely available online. The tilling platform was validated by the isolation of mutants for seven genes belonging to multigene families of the lignin biosynthesis pathway. In particular, a large allelic series for BdCOMT6, a caffeic acid O-methyl transferase was identified. Some mutants show lower lignin content when compared to wild-type plants as well as a typical decrease of syringyl units, a hallmark of COMT-deficient plants. The mutation rate was estimated at one mutation per 396 kb, or an average of 680 mutations per line. The collection was also used to assess the Genetically Effective Cell Number that was shown to be at least equal to 4 cells in Brachypodium distachyon.

Microcystins (MCs) are the most frequent and widely studied hepatotoxins, with potentially hazardous repercussions on aquatic organisms. As a ubiquitous herbivore living in eutrophic freshwaters, the snail Lymnaea stagnalis (Gastropoda: Pulmonata) is particularly exposed to cyanobacteria. The toxic filamentous Planktothrix agardhii is common in temperate lakes and is therefore, a potential food resource for gastropods. In the first part of this study, we demonstrated the ingestion of toxic P. agardhii by L. stagnalis during a 5 weeks exposure, with concomitant accumulation of, on average, 60% of total MCs ingested. After 3 weeks of non-toxic food (lettuce), approximately 90% of MCs were eliminated from tissues. Here, we investigate the impact of toxic P. agardhii consumption on the life-history traits (survival, growth and fecundity), locomotion and the structure of digestive and genital glands of juvenile and adult L. stagnalis. We observed a decrease of growth regardless of age, although this was more marked in juveniles, and a reduction of fecundity in adults. Survival and locomotion were not affected. Reduction of growth and fecundity continued to be observed even after feeding of non-toxic food for 3 weeks. The structure of the digestive gland was altered during the intoxication period but not irreversibly as cells tended to recover a normal status after the 3-week detoxification period. No histopathological changes occurred in the genital gland and oocytes, and spermatozoids were present in the gonadic acini. The density of cyanobacterial suspensions used in this study was comparable to those regularly observed in lakes, particularly in eutrophic waters. These results are discussed in terms of the negative impact of toxic cyanobacteria on natural communities of freshwater gastropods, and potential cascading effects on the equilibrium and functioning of the ecosystem.'>}\n"

Thanks to developments of atmospheric pressure discharges, new application areas have been opened, especially in the control of hemostasis, treatment of wounds and ulcers or dental care, next to older applications like sterilization or decontamination. Among the recent results obtained, the most striking is probably the evidence of an in vitro and in vivo antitumor effect of cold plasma. In this domain, we first demonstrate an antitumor effect of an in vivo Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma treatment on U87-luc glioma tumors. Not only the treatment was safe for the animals, but we observed a strong bioluminescence decrease associated with a reduction of tumor volume in U87 glioma-bearing mice. Using a new device developed in the lab, the Plasma Gun [1], which allows plasma treatments at long distance from the discharge reactor, we then demonstrate effect of cold plasmas on heterotopic and orthotopic colon carcinoma [2]. That led to assess the antitumor effect of NTP alone or in combination with Gemcitabine, a reference chemotherapeutic agent with radiosensitizing properties, on pancreatic cancer for which, in most cases, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are only, up to now, palliative treatments. Experiments were carried out using the Plasma Gun both in vitro on MIA PaCa2-luc cell lines (ductal adenocarcinoma cells), then in vivo on orthotopically grafted tumor cells to induce a pancreatic carcinoma model in immune deficient nude mice. The striking results of these series of experiments is that, not only, the plasma treatment appeared more efficient than Gemcitabine alone, but that the combination of both (see Figure 1) led to a most effective tumor growth inhibition (mass reduction of 87 % at Day 36) supporting the possible interest to use NTP in combination with a chemotherapeutical agent'>}\n",

Faecal endogenous phosphorus is the main pathway of phosphorus excretion and averages 0.85 of total faecal phosphorus. The remaining 0.15 is unabsorbed dietary phosphorus. Faecal endogenous phosphorus is mainly unabsorbed phosphorus, with saliva being the major source, and is correlated to factors influencing saliva secretion (DM intake, physical dietary characteristics and dietary phosphorus content). Another source of faecal endogenous phosphorus is rumen microbial phosphorus that escaped solubilisation during post-rumen digestion. All factors stimulating microbial growth would increase phosphorus uptake by the rumen microbes and consequently the faecal endogenous phosphorus. Understanding the determinants of faecal endogenous phosphorus flow will help to precise the determination of net phosphorus requirements for maintenance.

We found that all traits were conserved within lineages, but nevertheless communities assembled from many lineages showed a smaller variation in trait-states of most traits (including dispersal traits) than communities assembled from few lineages. Hence, within lineages, species are not randomly assembled into communities, contradicting Neutral Theory.

A total of 488 F2 males issued from six F1 boars and 23 F1 sows, the progeny of six LW boars and six MS sows, were slaughtered at approximately 80 kg live weight and were submitted to a standardised cutting of the carcass. Fifteen traits, i.e. dressing percentage, loin, ham, shoulder, belly, backfat, leaf fat, feet and head weights, two backfat thickness and one muscle depth measurements, ham + loin and back + leaf fat percentages and estimated carcass lean content were analysed. Animals were typed for a total of 137 markers covering the entire porcine genome. Analyses were performed using a line-cross (LC) regression method where founder lines were assumed to be fixed for different QTL alleles and a half/full sib (HFS) maximum likelihood method where allele substitution effects were estimated within each half-/full-sib family. Additional analyses were performed to search for multiple linked QTL and imprinting effects. Significant gene effects were evidenced for both leanness and fatness traits in the telomeric regions of SSC 1q and SSC 2p, on SSC 4, SSC 7 and SSC X. Additional significant QTL were identified for ham weight on SSC 5, for head weight on SSC 1 and SSC 7, for feet weight on SSC 7 and for dressing percentage on SSC X. LW alleles were associated with a higher lean content and a lower fat content of the carcass, except for the fatness trait on SSC 7. Suggestive evidence of linked QTL on SSC 7 and of imprinting effects on SSC 6, SSC 7, SSC 9 and SSC 17 were also obtained.'>, <Ref doi '10.1051/gse:2002026'>}\n"

An early key-step, the \"angiogenic switch\", allows tumour growth. Pathologic angiogenesis is a cancer hallmark as it features results of tumour-specific properties that can be summarised as a response to hypoxia. The hypoxic state occurs when the tumour mass reaches a volume sufficient not to permit oxygen diffusion inside the tumour centre. Thus tumour cells turn on adaptation mechanisms to the low pO2 level, inducing biochemical responses in terms of cytokines/chemokines/receptors and consequently recruitment of specific cell types, as well as cell-selection inside the tumour. Moreover, these changes are orchestrated by the microRNA balance strongly reflecting the hypoxic milieu and mediating the cross-talk between endothelial and tumour cells. MicroRNAs control of the endothelial precursor-vascular settings shapes the niche for selection of cancer stem cells.'>}\n"

Oxygen delivery remains impaired because tumor vessels are anarchic and leaky, contributing to tumor cell dissemination. Counteracting hypoxia by normalizing tumor vessels in order to improve drug and radio therapy efficacy and avoid cancer stem-like cell selection is a highly challenging issue. We show here that inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) treatment stably increases oxygen tension and blood flow in melanoma and breast cancer syngeneic models. It suppresses hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and proangiogenic/glycolysis genes and proteins cascade. It selectively activates the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in vitro and in vivo at the endothelial cell (EC) level thus inhibiting PI3K and reducing tumor AKT phosphorylation. These mechanisms normalize tumor vessels by EC reorganization, maturation, pericytes attraction, and lowering progenitor cells recruitment in the tumor. It strongly reduces vascular leakage, tumor growth, drug resistance, and metastasis. ITPP treatment avoids cancer stem-like cell selection, multidrug resistance (MDR) activation and efficiently enhances chemotherapeutic drugs activity. These data show that counteracting tumor hypoxia by stably restoring healthy vasculature is achieved by ITPP treatment, which opens new therapeutic options overcoming hypoxia-related limitations of antiangiogenesis-restricted therapies. By achieving long-term vessels normalization, ITPP should provide the adjuvant treatment required in order to overcome the subtle definition of therapeutic windows for in vivo treatments aimed by the current strategies against angiogenesis-dependent tumors.'>, <Ref pubmed '23471434'>}\n"

The chronic infection in immunocompetent patients, usually considered as asymptomatic, is now suspected to be a risk factor for various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to estimate the risk of epilepsy due to toxoplasmosis. A systematic literature search was conducted of several databases and journals to identify studies published in English or French, without date restriction, which looked at toxoplasmosis (as exposure) and epilepsy (as disease) and met certain other inclusion criteria. The search was based on keywords and suitable combinations in English and French. Fixed and random effects models were used to determine odds ratios, and statistical significance was set at 5.0%. Six studies were identified, with an estimated total of 2888 subjects, of whom 1280 had epilepsy (477 positive for toxoplasmosis) and 1608 did not (503 positive for toxoplasmosis). The common odds ratio (calculated) by random effects model was 2.25 (95% CI 1.27-3.9), p = 0.005. Despite the limited number of studies, and a lack of high-quality data, toxoplasmosis should continue to be regarded as an epilepsy risk factor. More and better studies are needed to determine the real impact of this parasite on the occurrence of epilepsy.'>, <RefJournal 'plos neglected tropical diseases' pe0003525 issn:1935-2735 issue:2 volume:9>, <Ref pubmed '25695802'>}\n",

Therefore, the question of whether laboratory engineering has an impact on protein dynamics is of general interest. Here, we demonstrate that two homologous, naturally evolved enzymes with high degrees of structural and functional conservation also exhibit conserved dynamics. Their similar set of slow timescale dynamics is highly restricted, consistent with evolutionary conservation of a functionally important feature. However, we also show that dynamics of a laboratory-engineered chimeric enzyme obtained by recombination of the two homologs exhibits striking difference on the millisecond timescale, despite function and high-resolution crystal structure (1.05 Å) being conserved. The laboratory-engineered chimera is thus functionally tolerant to modified dynamics on the timescale of catalytic turnover.

It uses a constant size routing table of O(k) contacts for allowing lookups in O(log N) message exchange (where N is the number of nodes participating). It can also be parametrized for obtaining O(log N / log log N) steps lookups with a routing table of size O(k log N). These bounds hold with high probability. Moreover, the protocol allows load balancing of hotspots of requests for a given key as well as hotspots of key collisions.

We assessed the contribution of SA and JA to basal and partial resistance of Arabidopsis to the biotrophic clubroot agent Plasmodiophora brassicae. SA and JA levels as well as the expression of the SA-responsive genes PR2 and PR5 and the JA-responsive genes ARGAH2 and THI2.1 were monitored in infected roots of the accessions Col-0 (susceptible) and Bur-0 (partially resistant). SA signaling was activated in Bur-0 but not in Col-0. The JA pathway was weakly activated in Bur-0 but was strongly induced in Col-0. The contribution of both pathways to clubroot resistance was then assessed using exogenous phytohormone application and mutants affected in SA or JA signaling. Exogenous SA treatment decreased clubroot symptoms in the two Arabidopsis accessions, whereas JA treatment reduced clubroot symptoms only in Col-0. The cpr5-2 mutant, in which SA responses are constitutively induced, was more resistant to clubroot than the corresponding wild type, and the JA signaling-deficient mutant jar1 was more susceptible. Finally, we showed that the JA-mediated induction of NATA1 drove N(δ)-acetylornithine biosynthesis in infected Col-0 roots. The 35S::NATA1 and nata1 lines displayed reduced or enhanced clubroot symptoms, respectively, thus suggesting that in Col-0 this pathway was involved in the JA-mediated basal clubroot resistance. Overall, our data support the idea that, depending on the Arabidopsis accession, both SA and JA signaling can play a role in partial inhibition of clubroot development in compatible interactions with P. brassicae.'>}\n",

In this study, we investigated the possible role of camalexin accumulation in two Arabidopsis genotypes with different levels of basal resistance to the compatible eH strain of the clubroot agent Plasmodiophora brassicae. Camalexin biosynthesis was induced in infected roots of both Col-0 (susceptible) and Bur-0 (partially resistant) accessions during the secondary phase of infection. However, the level of accumulation was four-to-seven times higher in Bur-0 than Col-0. This was associated with the enhanced transcription of a set of camalexin biosynthetic P450 genes in Bur-0: CYP71A13, CYP71A12, and CYP79B2. This induction correlated with slower P. brassicae growth in Bur-0 compared to Col-0, thus suggesting a relationship between the levels of camalexin biosynthesis and the different levels of resistance. Clubroot-triggered biosynthesis of camalexin may also participate in basal defense in Col-0, as gall symptoms and pathogen development were enhanced in the pad3 mutant (Col-0 genetic background), which is defective in camalexin biosynthesis. Clubroot and camalexin responses were then studied in Heterogeneous Inbred Families (HIF) lines derived from a cross between Bur-0 and Col-0. The Bur/Col allelic substitution in the region of the previously identified clubroot resistance QTL PbAt5.2 (Chromosome 5) was associated with both the enhanced clubroot-triggered induction of camalexin biosynthesis and the reduced P. brassicae development. Altogether, our results suggest that high levels of clubroot-triggered camalexin biosynthesis play a role in the quantitative control of partial resistance of Arabidopsis to clubroot.'>, <Ref doi '10.3389/fpls.2015.00539'>}\n"

Each technology exhibits good properties to reduce efficiently Diesel NOx emissions in order to match the forthcoming EURO 6 standards.NOx reduction in LNT is made through a two-step process. In normal (lean) mode, Diesel engine exhausts NOx is stored into the NOx trap; then when necessary the engine runs rich during limited time to treat the stored NOx. This operating mode has the benefit of using onboard fuel as NOx reducer. But NOx trap solution is restrained by limited active temperature windows. On the other hand, NH3-SCR catalysts operate in a wider range of temperature and do not contain precious metals. However, NH3-SCR systems traditionally use urea-water solution as reducing agent, requiring thus additional infrastructure to supply the vehicles with enough reducer. These pros and cons are quite restrictive in classical LNT or NH3-SCR architecture.The present paper presents an after-treatment architecture combining a NOx trap and a passive NH3-SCR. Synergy of the two systems is possible if the SCR takes advantage of the LNT ability to produce Ammonia (NH3). Indeed, during the rich phases (purges), small amounts of Ammonia are formed as by-product, which can be used in the downstream catalyst as the NOx reducing agent.A major difficulty to operate the proposed architecture is the real-time management of the NOx purge: for future control and diagnosis applications, it is crucial to have accurate but low-complexity models. A complete reduced model of the physicochemical phenomena involved is proposed in the present paper. Based on simplified chemical assumptions and time scale separation, the latter is suitable for on-board diagnostics and model-based control. Validation has been achieved through extensive experiments.'>}\n"

After heterogeneous hydrolysis using acidic Montmorillonite K10 clay, the DHcoPs were thioacidolyzed and analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Comparison of the thioacidolyzed products, with and without the hydrolysis step, showed that there was a greater proportion of condensation reaction in the absence of aldehyde. When the coniferaldehyde content in the initial synthetic mixture was more than 30% (w/w), only a low fraction of condensed products was generated during the K10 clay hydrolysis step. This suggests that condensation pathways are mainly due to the alcohol present in the γ-position in the DHcoPs.

Currently, evidence and explanations for recombination cessation in fungi are sparse, and the presence of evolutionary strata has been examined in a minimal number of fungal taxa. Here, the basidiomycete genus Microbotryum was used to determine the history of recombination cessation for loci on the mating-type chromosomes. Ancestry of linkage with mating type for 13 loci was assessed across 20 species by a phylogenetic method. No locus was found to exhibit trans-specific polymorphism for alternate alleles as old as the mating pheromone receptor, indicating that ages of linkage to mating type varied among the loci. The ordering of loci in the ancestry of linkage to mating type does not agree with their previously proposed assignments to evolutionary strata. This study suggests that processes capable of influencing divergence between alternate alleles may act at loci in the nonrecombining regions (e.g., gene conversion) and encourages further work to dissect the evolutionary processes acting upon genomic regions that determine mating compatibility.'>}\n",

Modeling and in situ sampling of a young Agulhas ring indicate that strong vertical mixing drives complex nitrogen cycling, shaping community metabolism and biogeochemical signatures as the ring and associated plankton transit westward.

In this present work, we identify and characterize a transcription factor i.e. HIC1, which physically interacts with both Bcl11b/CTIP2 and HMGA1 to co-regulate specific subsets of cellular genes and the viral HIV-1 gene. Our results suggest that HIC1 represses Tat dependent HIV-1 transcription. Interestingly, this repression of Tat function is linked to HIC1 K314 acetylation status and to SIRT1 deacetylase activity. Finally, we show that HIC1 interacts and cooperates with HGMA1 to regulate Tat dependent HIV-1 transcription. Our results also suggest that HIC1 repression of Tat function happens in a TAR dependent manner and that this TAR element may serve as HIC1 reservoir at the viral promoter to facilitate HIC1/TAT interaction.'>, <Ref doi '10.1038/srep34920'>}\n",

It was designed in Nançay with national and international collaboration. Antenna radiators were modeled on the LWA antenna design whereas preamplifiers were designed in France. Antennas will be distributed in 96 mini-arrays of 19 dual-polarized elements, densely covering a disk of 400 m in diameter. A few mini-arrays are expected to lie at distances of 2-3 km. A silent control-command system was designed, and the computer dialog with LOFAR defined. Receivers will include the LOFAR backend, a local beamformer and a local correlator. NenuFAR is in construction in Nançay and it was recently granted by the SKA office the official label of SKA pathfinder. Its exploitation will expand the scope of LOFAR scientific studies as well as permit new studies, preparing for SKA science. The NenuFAR concept has many points in common with GURT (the Giant Ukrainian Radio Telescope), with which it shares some technical studies, an its exploitation will benefit from a coordination with UTR-2.

We have identified, in a rodent model of graft rejection, a new molecule expressed by dendritic cells that we have named LIMLE (RGD1310371). To characterize this new molecule, we analyzed its regulation of expression and its function. We observed that LIMLE mRNAs were rapidly and strongly up regulated in dendritic cells following inflammatory stimulation. We demonstrated that LIMLE inhibition does not alter dendritic cell maturation or cytokine production following Toll-like-receptor stimulation. However, it reduces their ability to stimulate effector T cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction or T cell receptor transgenic system. Interestingly, we observed that LIMLE protein localized with actin at some areas under the plasma membrane. Moreover, LIMLE is highly expressed in testis, trachea, lung and ciliated cells and it has been shown that cilia formation bears similarities to formation of the immunological synapse which is required for the T cell activation by dendritic cells. Taken together, these data suggest a role for LIMLE in specialized structures of the cytoskeleton that are important for dynamic cellular events such as immune synapse formation. In the future, LIMLE may represent a new target to reduce the capacity of dendritic cells to stimulate T cells and to regulate an immune response.'>, <Ref doi '10.1371/journal.pone.0093894'>}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref fr_abstract \"Les Métalloprotéases matricielles (MMPs) constituent une famille des métalloprotéases à zinc capables conjointement de dégrader l'ensemble des protéines de la matrice extracellulaire. Aujourd'hui, vingt-trois MMPs humaines ont été identifiées et sont caractérisées par leur séquence en aminoacides et leur structure 3D fortement conservées. Ces enzymes sont exprimées de manière constitutive au cours des processus de remodelage tissulaire. Leur surexpression dans un certain nombre de pathologies étroitement liée au phénomène d'inflammation (arthrite, emphysème, cancer) fait des MMPs des cibles thérapeutiques de choix. Cependant, le remodelage entraînant des modifications des contacts cellulaires, les MMPs apparaissent aujourd'hui comme des protéines des voies de signalisation à part entière. Les récentes découvertes de substrats des MMPs ne faisant pas partie des constituants de la matrice extracellulaire renforcent cette vision. Dans le but d'identifier le rôle particulier et le taux d'expression protéique des MMPs dans un contexte pathologique, nous avons développé une technique de protéomique fonctionnelle dédiée à la détection des formes actives des MMPs dans des échantillons tumoraux. Cette technique repose sur le développement d'une nouvelle sonde de photoaffinité, basée sur la structure d'un puissant inhibiteur des MMPs de type phosphinique, permettant de cibler les MMPs sous forme active et de les isoler par marquage par photoaffinité. Le marquage par photoaffinité nous permet ainsi grâce à un élément radioactif incorporé à la sonde de radiomarquer les protéines ciblées. Cette sonde a montré in vitro sa capacité remarquable à modifier de manière covalente la hMMP-12 avec un rendement de 42 %, affichant une sensibilité extrême de détection (2.5 fmoles de hMMP-12). En présence de protéome complexe, la sensibilité de détection de la sonde pour la hMMP-12 est tout à fait comparable (5 fmoles) ; la hMMP-12 représente une fraction de 0.001 % de la quantité totale des protéines. Cette méthode nous a permis également d'identifier de manière indirecte les formes actives des gélatinases en comparant les extraits tumoraux traités par la sonde et les extraits tumoraux analysés en zymographie. Ces études indiquent que les niveaux d'expression des formes actives de MMPs sont très faibles (fmoles) ne permettant pas une caractérisation de celles-ci par spectrométrie de masse, ce qui constitue un véritable défi pouvant être abordé avec de nouvelles sondes incorporant une biotine. Cet exemple de protéines exprimées sous forme active en très faible abondance, implique une orientation des efforts à consentir vers le développement de nouvelles stratégies de capture.\">}\n",

The main idea is to guide and track the beam with a hybrid micro/nanomanipulator which is driven by a control signal generated by processing the beam intensity sensed by a four-quadrant photodiode. Since the pointing location of the beam depends on real-time control issues related to temperature variation, vibrations, output intensity control, and collimation of the light output, the 2-D beam location to the photodiode sensor measurement output is estimated in real-time. We use the Kalman filter (KF) algorithm for estimating the state of the linear system necessary for implementing the proposed track-following control approach. To do so a robust master/slave control strategy for dual-stage micro/nanomanipulator is presented based on sensitivity function decoupling design methodology. The decoupled feedback controller is synthesized and implemented in a 6 dof micro/nanomanipulator capable of nanometer resolution through several hundreds micrometer range. A case study relevant to tracking a laser-beam for imaging purposes is presented.'>}\n",

In such contexts, it is crucial to identify potential threats related to physical human-robot interactions and to assess the associated risks that might affect safety and dependability. Because of the complexity of human-robot interactions, rigorous and systematic approaches are needed to assist the developers in: i) the identification of significant threats and the implementation of efficient protection mechanisms to cope with these threats, and ii) the elaboration of a sound argumentation to justify the level of safety that can be achieved by the system. To fulfil these objectives, we believe that risk analysis should be carried out based on system models as soon as possible in the development process and hence provide elements to reason about system safety using a structured argumentation. The risk analysis method HAZOP-UML presented in this paper is a guided method to identify potential occurrences of harm, their causes and their severity. The results from risk analysis are then used as input for safety case construction in which we structure an argument about system safety.

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract 'Phylogenetic tree reconciliation is the approach of choice for investigating the coevolution of sets of organisms such as hosts and parasites. It consists in a mapping between the parasite tree and the host tree using event-based maximum parsimony. Given a cost model for the events, many optimal reconciliations are however possible. Any further biological interpretation of them must therefore take this into account, making the capacity to enumerate all optimal solutions a crucial point. Only two algorithms currently exist that attempt such enumeration; in one case not all possible solutions are produced while in the other not all cost vectors are currently handled. The objective of this paper is two-fold. The first is to fill this gap, and the second is to test whether the number of solutions generally observed can be an issue in terms of interpretation. We present a polynomial-delay algorithm for enumerating all optimal reconciliations. We show that in general many solutions exist. We give an example where, for two pairs of host-parasite trees having each less than 41 leaves, the number of solutions is 5120, even when only time-feasible ones are kept. To facilitate their interpretation, those solutions are also classified in terms of how many of each event they contain. The number of different classes of solutions may thus be notably smaller than the number of solutions, yet they may remain high enough, in particular for the cases where losses have cost 0. In fact, depending on the cost vector, both numbers of solutions and of classes thereof may increase considerably. To further deal with this problem, we introduce and analyse a restricted version where host switches are allowed to happen only between species that are within some fixed distance along the host tree. This restriction allows us to reduce the number of time-feasible solutions while preserving the same optimal cost, as well as to find time-feasible solutions with a cost close to the optimal in the cases where no time-feasible solution is found. We present Eucalypt, a polynomial-delay algorithm for enumerating all optimal reconciliations which is freely available at http://eucalypt.gforge.inria.fr/.'>}\n",

Because the 20460 70-mer oligo set was defined in 2004-2005 from heterogeneous data sources (http://www.ark-genomics.org), we checked the quality of the oligonucleotides, comparing them with the chromosomes of the 2.1 Washington University assembly of the Chicken Genome. This comparison was made using NCBI Blast 2 with a 75% similarity threshold over 50 base pairs. So we performed the annotation extraction only on the oligonucleotides found in a unique gene (even if it spanned on 2 exons). These annotations (Ensembl gene name, GO terms, orthologs, symbols corresponding to the human ortholog) were extracted from Ensembl using the blast HSP coordinates. Symbols for the human orthologs were validated with the HUGO gene nomenclature database using the GOret and HUGO_my_genes online tools (http://ouestgenopuces.univ-rennes1.fr/methodes_en.php). Other informations such as EC numbers and KEGG pathways IDs were extracted from bfind outputs and KEGG web pages. As results, among the 20460 gene-oligo, 13057 (64%) correspond to an unique coding region in a chicken genome sequence. From this oligo sub-set, only 32% presents an Ensembl gene name and/or a GO-biological process term. In contrast, 9360 (81%) presents a reliable human ortholog from which 1311 (14%) genes code enzymes. Among the 9360 genes, 7419 genes have a validated HUGO abbreviation, from which more GO terms could be extracted using different softwares (GOTM, Hugo-my-Genes) All bioinformatics procedures were developed by SIGENAE (INRA) and the results are available on site web: http://www.sigenae.org'>}\n",

En effet, en plus de ses très nombreuses applications dans des domaines d'activité très variés (médecine, pharmacologie, médecine, agrochimie...), le fluor occupe une place essentielle dans ce que l'on a coutume d'appeler le cycle du combustible nucléaire : il est un maillon indispensable pour la préparation du UF6 utilisé dans le procédé d'enrichissement de l'uranium employé dans les centrales nucléaires. Du fait de l'augmentation de la demande énergétique dans tous les pays industrialisés et émergents, la demande d'uranium enrichi et par voie de conséquence celle de F2 devrait croître fortement.

Leaf growth is one of the first macroscopic processes to be impacted by modification of soil water availability. In this study, we intended to analyze and compare plasticity at different scales. We examined the differential effect of water regime (optimal, moderate water deprivation and recovery) on growth and on the expression of candidate genes in leaves of different growth stages. Candidates were selected to assess components of growth response: abscisic acid signaling, water transport, cell wall modification and stomatal development signaling network. At the tree scale, the four studied poplar hybrids responded similarly to water regime. Meanwhile, leaf growth response was under genotype × environment interaction. Patterns of candidate gene expression enriched our knowledge about their functionality in poplars. For most candidates, transcript levels were strongly structured according to leaf growth performance while response to water regime was clearly dependent on genotype. The use of an index of plasticity revealed that the magnitude of the response was higher for gene expression than for macroscopic traits. In addition, the ranking of poplar genotypes for macroscopic traits well paralleled the one for gene expression.'>, <Ref doi '10.1111/ppl.12271'>, <RefJournal 'physiologia plantarum' p39-53 issn:1399-3054 issue:1 volume:154>}\n",

To evaluate the clinical benefit of adding a drug to a single-agent or two-agent chemotherapy regimen in terms of tumor response rate, survival, and toxicity in patients with advanced NSCLC. There were no language restrictions. Searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE were performed using the search terms non-small cell lung carcinoma/drug therapy, adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, lung, neoplasms, clinical trial phase III, and randomized trial. Manual searches were also performed to find conference proceedings published between January 1982 and June 2006. Data from all randomized controlled trials performed between 1980 and 2006 (published between January 1980 and June 2006) comparing a doublet regimen with a single-agent regimen or comparing a triplet regimen with a doublet regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC. Two independent investigators reviewed the publications and extracted the data. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for the objective tumor response rate, one-year survival rate, and toxicity rate were calculated using the fixed-effect model. Pooled median ratios (MRs) for median survival also were calculated using the fixed-effect model. ORs and MRs lower than unity (< 1.0) indicate a benefit of a doublet regimen compared with a single-agent regimen (or a triplet regimen compared with a doublet regimen). Sixty-five trials (13601 patients) were eligible. In the trials comparing a doublet regimen with a single-agent regimen, a significant increase was observed in tumor response (OR 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 to 0.47, P < 0.001) and one-year survival (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91, P < 0.001) in favor of the doublet regimen. The median survival ratio was 0.83 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.89, P < 0.001). An increase also was observed in the tumor response rate (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.75, P < 0.001) in favor of the triplet regimen, but not for one-year survival (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.21, P = 0.88). The median survival ratio was 1.00 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.06, P = 0.97). Adding a second drug improved tumor response and survival rate. Adding a third drug had a weaker effect on tumor response and no effect on survival.'>, <RefJournal 'the cochrane database of systematic reviews' pCD004569 issn:1469-493X issue:4 volume:1>}\n",

The objective of this study was to compare and characterize the digestion products during simulated digestion of powder(P)/liquid(L) infant formulas. Two commercial infant formulas of similar composition but in a powder or a liquid form were submitted to an in vitro dynamic digestive system. The digestion products from the gastric and intestinal compartments were characterized during 180 min by SDS-PAGE and Thin-Layer Chromatography to follow the kinetics of proteolysis and lipolysis, respectively. Changes in the structure of effluents were evaluated by confocal microscopy, light scattering and rheological methods. Results showed different structural and molecular behaviors between the 2 formulas. L had fat globules smaller than P, leading to a higher specific surface. After 30 min, protein destabilization was observed for both formulas and became definitive at 120 min. Viscosity of P and L was similar before digestion but increased dramatically for L at 120 min of gastric digestion. Overall, during the gastric phase, caseins were hydrolyzed more rapidly than the other milk proteins particularly for L and -lactoglobulin was more resistant to hydrolysis than caseins. The same behavior was observed for lipolysis kinetics with a more rapid hydrolysis of TAG for L than for P. During the intestinal phase, proteins were hydrolyzed instantaneously by the pancreatic enzymes and lipids were emulsified by bile salts, so that no difference in structure or in kinetics of hydrolysis was observed between the 2 formulas. Our results highlighted the impact of the structure of the 2 formulas on their behavior during the gastric phase that appears as a key step during in vitro digestion.'>}\n",

In this paper we investigate the power-to-phase coupling in two commercial high bandwidth P-I-N, near-IR photodetectors. We observe that a sudden change of the optical power induces a transient of the phase of the 20 GHz signal, at different time scales. The temperature rise of the photodetector junction is likely to be involved in this dynamical behaviour. The value of the bias voltage applied to the photodetector appears to control the size of the phase transients, as well as the optical power for which the slope of the amplitude-to-phase coupling cancels. The most efficient way to reduce amplitude to phase couplings consists in implementing optical demodulation, instead of electrical demodulation, of the microwave signal.'>}\n",

The IEEE-754 standard was a push towards straightening the field and made formal reasoning about floating-point computations easier and flourishing. Unfortunately, this is not sufficient to guarantee the final result of a program, as several other actors are involved: programming language, compiler, architecture. The CompCert formally-verified compiler provides a solution to this problem: this compiler comes with a mathematical specification of the semantics of its source language (a large subset of ISO C90) and target platforms (ARM, PowerPC, x86-SSE2), and with a proof that compilation preserves semantics. In this paper, we report on our recent success in formally specifying and proving correct CompCert's compilation of floating-point arithmetic. Since CompCert is verified using the Coq proof assistant, this effort required a suitable Coq formalization of the IEEE-754 standard; we extended the Flocq library for this purpose. As a result, we obtain the first formally verified compiler that provably preserves the semantics of floating-point programs.\">}\n",

Here, we investigated the role of EB1 in glioblastoma (GBM) tumor progression and its potential predictive role for response to Vinca-alkaloid chemotherapy. Immunohistological analysis of the 109 human GBM cases revealed that EB1 overexpression correlated with poor outcome including progression-free survival and overall survival. Downregulation of EB1 by shRNA inhibited cell migration and proliferation in vitro. Conversely, EB1 overexpression promoted them and accelerated tumor growth in orthotopically-transplanted nude mice. Furthermore, EB1 was largely overexpressed in stem-like GBM6 that display in vivo a higher tumorigenicity with a more infiltrative pattern of migration than stem-like GBM9. GBM6 showed strong and EB1-dependent migratory potential. The predictive role of EB1 in the response of GBM cells to chemotherapy was investigated. Vinflunine and vincristine increased survival of EB1-overexpressing U87 bearing mice and were more effective to inhibit cell migration and proliferation in EB1-overexpressing clones than in controls. Vinca inhibited the increase of MT growth rate and growth length induced by EB1 overexpression. Altogether, our results show that EB1 expression level has a prognostic value in GBM, and that Vinca-alkaloid chemotherapy could improve the treatment of GBM patients with EB1-overexpressing tumor.'>}\n"

OR genes are compared in relation to evolution and among species. OR gene structure and selection of a given gene for expression in an olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) are tackled. The specificities of OR proteins, their expression, and their function are presented. The expression of OR proteins in locations other than the nasal cavity is regulated by different mechanisms, and ORs display various additional functions. A conventional olfactory signal transduction cascade is observed in OSNs, but individual ORs can also mediate different signaling pathways, through the involvement of other molecular partners and depending on the odorant ligand encountered. ORs are engaged in constitutive dimers. Ligand binding induces conformational changes in the ORs that regulate their level of activity depending on odorant dose. When present, odorant binding proteins induce an allosteric modulation of OR activity. Since no 3D structure of an OR has been yet resolved, modeling has to be performed using the closest G-protein-coupled receptor 3D structures available, to facilitate virtual ligand screening using the models. The study of odorant binding modes and affinities may infer best-bet OR ligands, to be subsequently checked experimentally. The relationship between spatial and steric features of odorants and their activity in terms of perceived odor quality are also fields of research that development of computing tools may enhance.'>}\n",

Among these effects, parametric scattering and related effects [2,3] are very interesting and promising candidates for the realization of micro-metric and integrable sources for quantum information applications. Optical parametric oscillation (OPO) in microcavity-based systems has been successfully demonstrated in multiple cavities as well as in one-dimensional cavities [2,4]. In these systems the excitation can be done under normal incidence, eventually relaxing the strong coupling constraint [4]. Moreover, exploiting an energy-degenerate configuration, Signal end Idler beams are perfectly balanced in intensity. Here, we address the second-order coherence properties of parametric emission in one dimensional microcavities. We measured the g(2) function at zero time-delay using a HBT interferometer, gathering information about the photon statistics of the emission. Our data shows that across the parametric oscillation threshold a change in the statistics of the emission occurs, going from a thermal-like source towards a partially coherent source. These results allows highlighting substantial differences between a polariton-based micro-OPO and the behavior expected for a standard OPO. [1] P.G. Savvidis et al. Phys. Rev.

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract 'Conventional agriculture is based on a high level of chemical inputs such as pesticides and fertilisers, leading to serious environmental impacts, health risks and loss of biodiversity in agrosystems. The reduction of pesticide use is a priority for intensively sprayed agricultural systems such as orchards. The preservation and promotion of biodiversity within orchards and their boundaries is therefore an issue to explore. Indeed, orchard systems contain high plant diversity and perennial multi-strata designs that provide wealthy resources and habitats to living communities such as beneficial organisms. Orchards thus offer favourable areas to maintain food-webs within the agrosystem, provided that favourable situations are not altered by cultural practices such as applying an excess of pesticides. Here, we analysed literature on the effects of the manipulation of plant diversity and habitats on the control of pests by arthropod and bird communities in apple, pear and peach orchards. Many investigations focus on the role of plant management to enhance biodiversity in orchards but only 22 research reports presenting 30 case studies were dedicated to the study of the ecosystem service provided by plant diversity for orchard pest control. The underlying mechanisms were seldom demonstrated, and the tested grass covers and tree assemblages aimed at favouring either the beneficial complex or only some beneficial species to control one or a few pests. The effect of plant management on pest control was mostly positive (16 cases) or null (9), but also negative in some cases (5). This finding reveals the difficulties of identifying selected plants or plant assemblages for the control of key pests. We conclude that further research is needed to identify the processes involved on different scales for biological control. Orchard systems should be re-designed to optimise ecosystem services provided by biodiversity.'>}\n",

We propose an inductive procedure proving C-reducibility of rewriting. The rewriting relation on ground terms is simulated through an abstraction mechanism and narrowing. The induction hypothesis allows assuming that terms smaller than the starting terms rewrite into a constructor term.

We propose to investigate genotype-phenotype associations by methodical use of alleles that lack single interactions, while retaining all others, in contrast to genetic approaches designed to eliminate gene products completely. We describe an integrated strategy based on the reverse yeast two-hybrid system to isolate and characterize such edge-specific, or 'edgetic', alleles. We established a proof of concept with CED-9, a Caenorhabditis elegans BCL2 ortholog. Using ced-9 edgetic alleles, we uncovered a new potential functional link between apoptosis and a centrosomal protein. This approach is amenable to higher throughput and is particularly applicable to interactome network analysis in organisms for which transgenesis is straightforward.\">, <Ref pubmed '19855391'>, <RefJournal 'nature methods' p843 issn:1548-7105 issue:11 volume:6>, <Ref doi '10.1038/nmeth.1394'>}\n",

To investigate microbe-mineral-fluid interactions in hydrothermal chimney and the driver of microbial diversity, a cultural approach using a gas-lift bioreactor was chosen. An enrichment culture was performed using crushed active chimney sample as inoculum and diluted hydrothermal fluid from the same vent as culture medium. Daily sampling provided time-series access to active microbial diversity and medium composition. Active archaeal and bacterial communities consisted mainly of sulfur, sulfate and iron reducers and hydrogen oxidizers with the detection of Thermococcus, Archaeoglobus, Geoglobus, Sulfurimonas and Thermotoga sequences. The simultaneous presence of active Geoglobus sp. and Archaeoglobus sp. argues against competition for available carbon sources and electron donors between sulfate and iron reducers at high temperature. This approach allowed the cultivation of microbial populations that were under-represented in the initial environmental sample. The microbial communities are heterogeneously distributed within the gas-lift bioreactor; it is unlikely that bulk mineralogy or fluid chemistry is the drivers of microbial community structure. Instead, we propose that micro-environmental niche characteristics, created by the interaction between the mineral grains and the fluid chemistry, are the main drivers of microbial diversity in natural systems.'>, <Ref doi '10.1007/s00792-015-0742-5'>}\n",

Ideally, III-V nanowires integrated on silicon should be entirely free of extended planar defects such as twins, stacking faults, or polytypism, position-controlled for convenient device processing, and gold-free for compatibility with standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing tools. Here we demonstrate large area vertical GaAsxSb1-x nanowire arrays grown on silicon (111) by molecular beam epitaxy. The nanowires' complex faceting, pure zinc blende crystal structure, and composition are mapped using characterization techniques both at the nanoscale and in large-area ensembles. We prove unambiguously that these gold-free nanowires are entirely twin-free down to the first bilayer and reveal their three-dimensional composition evolution, paving the way for novel infrared devices integrated directly on the cost-effective Si platform.\">}\n",

Following whole genome duplication, structural and functional modifications result in differential gene content or regulation in the duplicated regions, which can play a fundamental role in the diversification of genes underlying complex traits. We have investigated this issue in Brassica napus, a species with a highly duplicated genome, with the aim of studying the structural and functional organization of duplicated regions involved in quantitative resistance to stem canker, a disease caused by the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans. Genome-wide association analysis on two oilseed rape panels confirmed that duplicated regions of ancestral blocks E, J, R, U, and W were involved in resistance to stem canker. The structural analysis of the duplicated genomic regions showed a higher gene density on the A genome than on the C genome and a better collinearity between homoeologous regions than paralogous regions, as overall in the whole B. napus genome. The three ancestral sub-genomes were involved in the resistance to stem canker and the fractionation profile of the duplicated regions corresponded to what was expected from results on the B. napus progenitors. About 60% of the genes identified in these duplicated regions were single-copy genes while less than 5% were retained in all the duplicated copies of a given ancestral block. Genes retained in several copies were mainly involved in response to stress, signaling, or transcription regulation. Genes with resistance-associated markers were mainly retained in more than two copies. These results suggested that some genes underlying quantitative resistance to stem canker might be duplicated genes. Genes with a hydrolase activity that were retained in one copy or R-like genes might also account for resistance in some regions. Further analyses need to be conducted to indicate to what extent duplicated genes contribute to the expression of the resistance phenotype.'>, <Ref doi '10.3389/fpls.2015.00772'>}\n",

A detailed description of knowledge sources of these technologies is discussed, including the role absorptive capacity plays in priming their development. This study addresses the contributions of the researcher, particularly in relation to the contributions of their academic and industrial co-authors and co-inventors. We find clear linkages, and varied degrees of knowledge transformation, between the technologies in their present form and long-past outputs of the individual, via the publications of the inventor and the literature cited by the patent applications.

We used high-throughput SNP molecular marker assays, flow cytometry, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to characterize a population of putative allohexaploids derived from self-pollination of a hybrid from the novel cross (B. napus × B. carinata) × B. juncea to investigate whether fertile, stable allohexaploid Brassica can be produced. Allelic segregation in the A and C genomes generally followed Mendelian expectations for an F2 population, with minimal nonhomologous chromosome pairing. However, we detected no strong selection for complete 2n = AABBCC chromosome complements, with weak correlations between DNA content and fertility (r(2) = 0.11) and no correlation between missing chromosomes or chromosome segments and fertility. Investigation of next-generation progeny resulting from one highly fertile F2 plant using FISH revealed general maintenance of high chromosome numbers but severe distortions in karyotype, as evidenced by recombinant chromosomes and putative loss/duplication of A- and C-genome chromosome pairs. Our results show promise for the development of meiotically stable allohexaploid lines, but highlight the necessity of selection for 2n = AABBCC karyotypes.'>, <RefJournal 'genetics' p273 issn:1943-2631 issue:1 volume:197>, <Ref pubmed '24558262'>}\n",

The partially isohomoeoallelic line, designated RR239, had a meiotic behaviour as regular as cv. Courtot. It was characterised using genomic in situ hybridization and microsatellite markers as well as biochemical and proteomic approaches. The translocated 1D chromosome had an interstitial 1AL segment representing in average 30% of the recombinant arm length that was confirmed by molecular analysis. The genetic length of the removed segment in chromosome 1DL was estimated to be at least 51 cM, and that of the interstitial 1AL translocation to be at least 33 cM. Proteome analysis performed on total endosperm proteins revealed variation in amounts, 8 spots and 1 spot being up- and downregulated, respectively.

It is clear that improvements in using new targeted therapies are required to improve breast cancer (BC) outcome. Nevertheless, to achieve this, new molecular biomarkers are required to define the potential sensitivity or resistance of cancer cells. By targeting the mTOR pathway, several critical central transduction pathways that sustain BC are abrogated (HER-2/Neu and the estrogen receptor pathway). Thus, the compounds that inhibit mTOR have a double mechanism of toxicity on BC cells when used in combination with a currently used drug: (1) overcoming primary drug resistance and (2) restoring sensitivity when resistance arises after long-term exposure. This review covers the utility of inhibitors of the mTOR pathway in BC and emphasizes the new paradigm of close symbiosis between oncology and molecular biology to better profiling and treating BC with a targeted approach. In particular, we focused on the new drug RAD001 (Everolimus) due to the great results from preclinical and clinical trials make it the most hopeful compound among mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of BC.'>, <RefJournal 'breast cancer research and treatment' p599-606 issn:1573-7217 issue:3 volume:128>, <Ref doi '10.1007/s10549-010-0986-9'>}\n",

Given the conflicting goals of preserving the 2D aspect of the style and the 3D scene motion, any such solution is a trade-off. We observe that primitive-based methods in NPR can be seen as texture-based methods when using large numbers of primitives, leading to our key insight, namely that this process is similar to sparse convolution noise in procedural texturing. Consequently, we present a new primitive for NPR based on Gabor noise, that preserves the 2D aspect of noise, conveys the 3D motion of the scene, and is temporally continuous. We can thus use standard techniques from procedural texturing to create various styles, which we show for interactive NPR applications. We also present a user study to evaluate this and existing solutions, and to provide more insight in the trade-off implied by temporal coherence. The results of the study indicate that maintaining coherent motion is important, but also that our new solution provides a good compromise between the 2D aspect of the style and 3D motion.'>}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref fr_abstract \"La composition biochimique et les métabolismes tissulaires sont des éléments clés dans l'adaptation individuelle et participent à l’efficience des productions animales. En effet, l’énergie apportée par l’aliment peut être utilisée par la cellule pour son fonctionnement quotidien mais peut être aussi (transitoirement ou pas) mise en réserve, notamment sous forme de glycogène ou de lipides. Ces réserves énergétiques sont stockées dans des cellules spécialisées (cellule musculaire et hépatocyte pour le glycogène, adipocyte pour les lipides) ou peuvent coexister au sein d’une même cellule (lipides intra-myocellulaires, glycogène adipocytaire). Ces réserves permettent à la cellule de gérer la discontinuité dans la fourniture de nutriments par rapport aux besoins énergétiques, mais avec un coût métabolique associé non négligeable. Une cellule ou un tissu (ensemble plus ou moins hétérogène de cellules) peut être considéré(e) comme un système dont le fonctionnement concerté dépend des entités en présence et des interactions qui les lient. Nous proposons de développer un modèle dynamique générique visant à intégrer les connaissances stoechiométriques et les régulations sur les voies biochimiques cellulaires, pour comprendre la plasticité des réserves énergétiques chez l’animal en croissance, et en particulier les équilibres complexes entre stocks de glycogène et de lipides tissulaires. Dans ce but, un système d’équations différentielles ordinaires de production et de consommation de nutriments a été utilisé afin de représenter le métabolisme cellulaire. Chaque équation représente une réaction biochimique unique ou rassemble les transformations successives de plusieurs métabolites intermédiaires lorsque chacune d’entre elles n’est pas soumise à une régulation essentielle pour le phénomène modélisé. La vitesse de ces réactions est régulée principalement par l’activité de l’enzyme impliquée dans la réaction. Nous identifions alors les inhibiteurs et les activateurs de chaque enzyme. Notre modèle met en évidence l’indexation étroite du stock de glycogène au besoin énergétique cellulaire modélisé par l’évolution du ratio ATP/AMP. Le modèle confirme que l’augmentation de ce ratio (ex : entrée du glucose dans la cellule supérieur à son besoin en glucose pour produire de l’ATP), active d’abord la voie de la production du glycogène; lorsque une concentration donnée en glycogène est atteinte (fonction du type cellulaire), la synthèse des lipides est activée. Ce modèle est un premier pas pour décrire la complexité des voies métaboliques contrôlant l’équilibre énergétique cellulaire. Il permettra à terme de tester des scénarii nutritionnels (modulation des entrées en glucose ou en acides gras) chez l’animal en croissance. Il pourrait être étendu pour décrire le métabolisme d’autres nutriments (acides aminés) et/ou couplé à des modèles de flux pour décrire les phénomènes à l’échelle de l’animal.\">}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract 'Methionine (Met) is an essential sulfur amino acid (AA) limiting growth and is the precursor of cysteine (Cys), the rate-limiting factor in the synthesis of glutathione, and the main intracellular non-enzymatic antioxidant. This study aimed at determining the effects of limited supplies in Met and(or) Cys in early aspects of adipose tissue development and oxidative stress in differentiated adipocytes. Incremental reductions in Met (70, 40, and 0 µM) were compared with Met 100 µM (control dose) in porcine preadipocytes cultured in media without or with Cys (250 µM). In Cys-deprived media, both the absence (0 µM) and the lowest dose of Met (40 µM) reduced preadipocyte proliferation. Adding Cys in media only partly compensated for this decrease. On the opposite, mild Met deficiency (70 µM) did not alter preadipocyte proliferation in media without or with Cys. Strong Met deficiency (40 µM) also reduced differentiation and lipid accumulation into preadipose cells. Mild Met deficiency also reduced preadipocyte differentiation when Cys was present in the culture media, whereas in Cys-deprived media, percent of differentiated cell was similar and intracellular lipid content was slightly higher at Met 70 µM than at Met 100 µM. Finally, incremental reductions in Met in media with or without Cys lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by differentiated cells. These results demonstrate the strong dependency of porcine adipogenesis to sulfur AA supplies. Strong Met deficiency decreases both proliferation and differentiation, whereas mild deficiency only alters differentiation.'>, <Ref pubmed '27888346'>, <Ref doi '10.1007/s00726-016-2369-y'>}\n",

Suspicious behaviors are detected by comparing trace abstractions to reference malicious behaviors. The expressive power of abstraction allows us to handle general suspicious behaviors rather than specific malware code and then, to detect malware mutations.

The chronic nature of S. aureus mastitis makes it difficult to cure and prone to resurgence. In order to identify the bacterial factors involved in this chronicity, Newbould 305 (N305), a strain that can reproducibly induce mild and chronic mastitis in an experimental setting, was characterized in depth. We employed genomic and proteomic techniques combined with phenotype characterization, in order to comprehensively analyse N305. The results were compared with data obtained on S. aureus RF122, a strain representative of the major clone involved in severe bovine mastitis worldwide. Five mobile genetic elements were identified in the N305 genome as carrying virulence factors which correlated with phenotypic features such as cytotoxicity, mammary epithelial cell invasion or host-adaptation. In particular, the presence and characteristics of surface exposed proteins correlated well with the greater adhesion and internalization capacities of N305 in bovine mammary epithelial cells. N305 also displayed less diversity of toxin genes but secreted larger quantities of these toxins, associated with a higher cytotoxicity potential. Our data are consistent with the invasiveness and host-adaptation features which contribute to the chronicity of S. aureus mastitis. Mobile genetic elements, exoproteins and surface exposed proteins constitute good targets for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms related to mastitis chronicity.'>}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract 'Staphylococcus aureus is of major concern in milk industry, form farm to fork: it is one of the main pathogens responsible for mastitis and the first cause of food poisonings related to milk and milk products, in France. Contamination may come from raw milk (from mastitic cows), human carriers, who may also contaminate dairy products during manipulation, as well as strains endemic in the processing plant environment. The ability of some strains to form biofilms likely contributes to the persistence of S. aureus, by reducing efficiency of cleaning or antibacterial treatments. Likewise, biofilm have been evoked to explain chronicity of S. aureus mastitis, protecting S. aureus cells from host immune response and antibiotic treatments. Preventing biofilm formation by S. aureus thus appears as a key step in the fight against this pathogen. In the recent years, the concept of biological control has emerged as an interesting and sustainable alternative to fight against pathogens. We have recently established the capacity of L. lactis to affect S. aureus virulence expression under planktonic growth conditions and in cheese matrix (Cretenet et al., EMIR, 2011; Even et al., AEM, 2009). Here, we investigated the ability of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and Propionic Acid Bacteria (PAB) to affect S. aureus biofilm formation. Supernatants of 4 LAB and PAB species were tested for their ability to affect S. aureus biofilm formation by the crystal violet biofilm assay combined with direct visualization of biofilm using confocal microscopy. Several S. aureus strains able to produce a biofilm in various amounts, were included in the study. Results showed that LAB and PAB supernatants modulated either positively or negatively the dynamics of S. aureus biofilm formation in a strain- and species-dependent manner. These data were confirmed by direct observations of biofilms using confocal microscopy. Different biofilm properties, including biofilm thickness and density and the rate of surface colonization were modified, suggesting LAB and PAB were able to affect primary adhesion and maturation of S. aureus biofilm. Identification of mechanisms and effectors involved are under way.'>}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract 'Lipids provide most calories necessary for newborn growth and development. Lipid digestion is initiated by the Human Gastric lipase (HGL) which is already mature at birth and is a key lipase in neonatal digestion. HGL is supposed to attack directly Native Milk Fat Globules (NMFG) found in unprocessed milk despite their complex supramolecular structure and protective trilayered membrane. However, the specific action of HGL on this natural substrate has not been studied in detail, nor directly compared with the same substrate after processing into infant formula. This study aimed at comparing the digestion kinetics of NMFG with that of processed lipid droplets of a model infant formula, during gastric in vitro digestion and at immunolocalizing the gastric lipase during the hydrolysis of NMFG. Two matrices of similar chemical composition but differing in structure were formulated: M1 containing NMFG and M2 obtained by homogenization and pasteurization of M1. The matrices were submitted to a semi-dynamic gastric in vitro digestion mimicking in vivo data. Rabbit Gastric lipase (RGL) was used as an analogue of HGL. The matrices disintegration and their hydrolysis kinetics were monitored. In parallel, RGL was immunolocalized using confocal or transmission electron microscopy after static in vitro gastric digestion of NMFG. The initial structure affected strongly the lipolysis kinetics, with rates approximately 40 times higher for M2 compared to M1. This was mainly explained by the highest specific surface developed by M2 (31 vs 1.8 m2/g of lipids). Quasi similar rates were obtained when normalized by the lipid specific surface (~ 0.2 µmol/min/m2) which confirmed the low sensitivity of RGL to the interfacial quality. The RGL immunolocalization backed up its high penetration capacity: discreet and specific locations of RGL insertion in the NMFG membrane were observed These differences of lipolysis kinetics may impact gastric emptying via ‘duodenal break’ and have physiological consequences. Optimizing infant formula specific surface to mirror the gastric behavior of human milk appears as a potential lever to improve infant nutrition.'>}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract 'The first stage of intestinal lipolysis is catalyzed by Human Gastric Lipase (HGL). This extremophilic lipase presents specific properties: a low optimal pH range (4-5), a stability to pepsin and pH denaturation down to 1.5, a high tensioactivity allowing its adsorption at interface with low surface tension, a stereospecificity for the sn-3 position of triacylglycerides. Very similar properties are shared by few other gastric mammalian lipases, among which Rabbit Gastric Lipase (RGL). However none of these lipases have been commercially available up to now, which favored the use of acid- and protease-resistant fungic analogues, though their action specificity has not been extensively compared to HGL. This study aimed at comparing a fungic lipase (A12, Aspergillus niger, Amano) with RGL during the semi-dynamic gastric infant in vitro digestion of a model infant formula based on bovine milk. The matrix disintegration, the hydrolysis kinetics and the evolution of lipid composition during digestion were monitored. The matrix disintegration was similar with the two lipases. A12 liberated 18 % of initially esterified Fatty Acids (FA) in 180 min. This was coherent with in vivo studies and in the range with RGL liberation. The released FA reflected the initial composition of the substrate with a ratio in short/medium/long chain FA of 8:22:59 % mol. No preferential enrichment in short chain FA, which are mainly distributed in the sn-3 position of bovine milk triacylglycerol, was observed, whereas it was the case with RGL. The lipid classes analysis confirmed the low sn-1,3 selectivity of A12 lipase which liberated 1.5 % mol glycerol at 180 min whereas lipolysis end-products were restricted to free FA and sn-1,2 diacylglycerols for RGL. A12 presented an annex proteolytic activity. The limits of use of A12 as a HGL analogue have been highlighted. Instead, mammalian or sn-3 stereospecific lipases should be favored, especially when the lipid composition of the digesta has to reflect precisely the in vivo composition.'>}\n",

As no starter is added, lactic acid is produced by milk flora and flora released from the Tina biofilm. The aim of this work was to assess the safety and efficiency of this natural inoculation system. From 15 Tinas' biofilms, bacteria total counts varied from 10(3) to 10(6) CFU/cm(2), with the predominance of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria. Low counts of yeasts and moulds were found in a few Tinas. Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7 were totally absent, as assessed by conventional plating and the Bax detection system after enrichment, highlighting the safety of the system. From four Tinas out of the 15, micropieces of wood were observed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. The biofilm entrapped in a matrix covered almost entirely the surface of the wood. Polysaccharides were detected in the four Tinas. In three of the latter, cocci were predominant in the ecosystem whereas in the other one, cocci, bacilli, yeasts and moulds were observed. Fifty litres of microfiltrated milk (<10 CFU/mL) were poured in the four Tinas for 10 min of contact. Enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and enterococci were performed in the milk after contact. Depending on the Tina, from 5.10(4) to 10(6) CFU/mL of Streptococcus thermophilus were released into the milk, and from 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/mL of thermophilic lactobacilli. Spontaneous acidification after contact confirmed the high efficiency of biofilm lactic acid bacteria delivery.\">}\n",

We have investigated the impact of doses below the \"No Observed Adverse Effect\" (NOAEL) for vinclozolin (V), an anti-androgenic fungicide, alone or associated with xenoestrogens (Genistein, G and bisphenol-A, BPA). V, G, BPA and their combinations were administered orally to female Wistar rats during gestation and lactation. F1 and F2 offspring were investigated for skeletal anomalies at post-natal days 30, 110 (d30, d110). Skeletal development was monitored by measuring caudal vertebrae and long bones dimensions by X-ray micro-CT-scan. A significant increase in Inter Transverse Apophysis (ITA) distance at the upper head of caudal vertebrae, associated with a reduction in vertebral body height was observed in treated F1 females, but not males. Histometrical analysis of vertebral body growth plate cartilage was performed on serial sections of caudal vertebrae. F1 females but not males showed a diminution in growth plate thickness, with greater impact on the hypertrophic zone. All effects were maximal at d30. Effects on ITA width persisted until d110 while effects on growth plate disappeared. These effects were essentially vinclozolin or BPA-dependent. F2 animals were not affected. Our data suggest that vinclozolin and xenoestrogens act as cartilage developmental disruptors. We suggest that present NOAEL values for these compounds, and EDC at large, might be reconsidered using gestational exposure models. Finally, micro CT-scan appears a valuable non-invasive technique to detect EDC effects on live fauna.'>, <Ref pubmed '24333988'>}\n",

Agri-environmental policies contribute to these efforts by encouraging farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices within the vicinity of these ecosystems. A spatially targeted agri-environmental policy promotes natural amenities and may thereby affect household location decisions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent of these impacts on the spatial urban structure. We extend a monocentric city model to include farmers' responses to an agri-environmental policy. Our main findings are that the implementation of a spatially targeted agrienvironmental policy may lead to some additional urban development, which could conflict with the aim of the policy.\">}\n",

We conclude that gustatory stimulus following antennal contact is probably the key stimulus inducing oviposition behavior.

We recall that this model aims at taking into account the three main phenomena of the digestion, namely the transit of the bolus, the degradation of feedstuffs and the absorption through the intestinal wall. In order to study the role of dietary fibre on digestion, we model their two principal physiochemical characteristics which interact with the function of the small intestine, i.e. viscosity and water holding capacity. This leads us to consider some features of digestion which have not been taken into account previously, in particular the interrelationship between the evolution of dry matter and water in the bolus. The numerical results are in agreement with the positive effect of insoluble dietary fibre on the velocity of bolus along the small intestine and on its degradation. These results highlight the negative effect of soluble dietary fibre on digestion. Although, this model is generic and contains a large number of parameters, to our knowledge, it is among the first qualitative dynamical modelling of fibre influence on intestinal digestion.'>}\n",

We previously demonstrated that SA USA400 MW2 strain induces a G2/M phase delay in human HeLa cells. This phenomenon was associated with the accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1/cdc2 and with the accumulation of unphosphorylated histone H3. Additionally we showed that the G2 phase was preferential for staphylococcal internalization and intracellular replication (1). The objectives of the study were -to identify the active substances, which are responsible for the cell cycle alteration, -to understand, how this alteration hijacks defense functions of the host cells. Using size exclusion chromatography of MW2 supernatant, followed by mass spectroscopy analysis, we identified phenol-soluble modulin alpha (PSMα) peptides as the likely candidates for this effect. Indeed, synthetic PSMα1 and PSMα3 caused a G2/M phase transition delay. The implication of PSMα in cell cycle alteration was confirmed by comparison of wild type SA USA300 (strain LAC wt) with the isogenic mutant (LAC∆psmα), lacking the psmα operon that encodes PSMα1 to 4, for its internalization efficiency in HeLa cells. The decreased internalization rate of LAC∆psmα suggested a role of PSMα in host cell invasion. Furthermore, PSMα-induced G2/M-transition delay correlated with a decrease in the defensin genes expression suggesting a diminution of antibacterial functions of epithelial cells (2).

Among these toxins, only the ETD structure remained unknown, limiting our understanding of the structural determinants for the functional differentiation between these toxins. We recently identified an ETD-like protein associated to S. aureus strains involved in mild mastitis in sheep. The crystal structure of this ETD-like protein was determined at 1.95 Å resolution and the structural analysis provide insights into the oligomerization, stability and specificity and enabled a comprehensive structural comparison with ETA and ETB. Despite the highly conserved molecular architecture, significant differences in the composition of the loops and in both the N- and C-terminal α-helices seem to define ETD-like specificity. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these regions defining ET specificity present different degrees of flexibility and may undergo conformational changes upon substrate recognition and binding. DLS and AUC experiments indicated that the ETD-like is monomeric in solution whereas it is present as a dimer in the asymmetric unit indicating that oligomerization is not related to functional differentiation among these toxins. Differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism assays demonstrated an endothermic transition centered at 52 °C, and an exothermic aggregation in temperatures up to 64 °C.

Half of the proteins were found in both conditions but a substantial number were specifically found in in vivo conditions and gave indications about the active metabolic status and the stresses encountered by S. aureus within the cistern during a gangrenous mastitis.'>}\n",

S. aureus mastitis is difficult to treat and prone to recurrence despite antibiotic treatment. The ability of S. aureus to invade bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMEC) is evoked to explain this chronicity. One sustainable alternative to treat or prevent mastitis is the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as mammary probiotics. In this study, we tested the ability of Lactobacillus casei strains to prevent invasion of bMEC by two S. aureus bovine strains, RF122 and Newbould305, which reproducibly induce acute and moderate mastitis, respectively. L. casei strains affected adhesion and/or internalization of S. aureus in a strain-dependent manner. Interestingly, L. casei CIRM-BIA 667 reduced S. aureus Newbould305 and RF122 internalization by 60 to 80%, and this inhibition was confirmed for two other L. casei strains, including one isolated from bovine teat canal. The protective effect occurred without affecting bMEC morphology and viability. Once internalized, the fate of S. aureus was not affected by L. casei. It should be noted that L. casei was internalized at a low rate but survived in bMEC cells with a better efficiency than that of S. aureus RF122. Inhibition of S. aureus adhesion was maintained with heat-killed L. casei, whereas contact between live L. casei and S. aureus or bMEC was required to prevent S. aureus internalization. This first study of the antagonism of LAB toward S. aureus in a mammary context opens avenues for the development of novel control strategies against this major pathogen.'>}\n",

A better knowledge of the host-pathogen interactions is needed to tackle this serious animal health problem. This study aimed at identifying S. aureus proteins differentially expressed by S. aureus in nasal colonization versus mastitis. Serological proteome analysis (SERPA) was used to examine protein samples prepared from culture supernatants of S. aureus strains originally isolated from gangrenous mastitis and nasal carriage (O11) or subclinical mastitis (O46) and to compare patterns of immune-reactive proteins. These staphylococcal proteins were revealed by sera obtained from ewes suffering from S. aureus mastitis and by sera obtained from healthy nulliparous ewes (i.e. no lactation and no mastitis or other symptoms) that were nasally colonized by S. aureus. Altogether 49 staphylococcal immune-reactive proteins were identified in this study. Patterns of proteins revealed by sera from infected- or healthy carrier- animals were comparable and analysis singled out one immune-reactive protein, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase, which was recognized by each of the 6 sera from infected animals, when tested individually, and not by the sera of healthy carriers. This is the first study that compares the S. aureus seroproteome in colonization versus mastitis context in ruminants.

B. abortus causes abortion in pregnant cattle and undulant fever in humans. The immunogenic B. abortus ribosomal protein L7/L12 is a promising candidate antigen for the development of oral live vaccines against brucellosis, using food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a carrier. The L7/L12 gene was expressed in Lactococcus lactis, the model LAB, under the nisin-inducible promoter. Using different signals, L7/L12 was produced in cytoplasmic, cell-wall-anchored, and secreted forms. Cytoplasmic production of L7/L12 gave a low yield, estimated at 0.5 mg/liter. Interestingly, a secretable form of this normally cytoplasmic protein via fusion with a signal peptide resulted in increased yield of L7/L12 to 3 mg/liter; secretion efficiency (SE) was 35%. A fusion between the mature moiety of the staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc) and L7/L12 further increased yield to 8 mg/liter. Fusion with a synthetic propeptide (LEISSTCDA) previously described as an enhancer for heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis (Y. Le Loir, A. Gruss, S. D. Ehrlich, and P. Langella, J. Bacteriol. 180:1895-1903, 1998) raised the yield to 8 mg/liter and SE to 50%. A surface-anchored L7/L12 form in L. lactis was obtained by fusing the cell wall anchor of Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein to the C-terminal end of L7/L12. The fusions described allow the production and targeting of L7/L12 in three different locations in L. lactis.

As interesting as dynamic sequences may be, there is a need for the biologist or physician to get an efficient and complete representation of the entire imaged region. For this demand, the potential of this imaging modality is enhanced by using video mosaicing techniques. Classical mosaicing algorithms do not take into account the characteristics of fibered confocal microscopy, namely motion distortions, irregularly sampled frames and non-rigid deformations of the imaged tissue. Our approach is based on a hierarchical framework that is able to recover a globally consistent alignment of the input frames, to compensate for the motion distortions and to capture the non-rigid deformations. The proposed global alignment scheme is seen as an estimation problem on a Lie group. We model the relationship between the motion and the motion distortions to correct for these distortions. An efficient scattered data approximation scheme is proposed both for the construction of the mosaic and to adapt the demons registration algorithm to our irregularly sampled inputs.

Glucose is the principal precursor for the synthesis of lactose (a major osmotic agent in milk), and participates in determining the milk volume produced. When applying these two breeding factors, reductions in milk yield are associated with a reduction in milk lactose yield and in the arterial flow of glucose, due to a decrease in the mammary blood flow. The ability of the udder to extract glucose is altered with once-daily milking but not necessarily with feed restriction. Lactose synthesis is down-regulated in response to once-daily milking and feed restriction but the percentage of the extracted glucose which is converted into lactose is differently affected in response to treatments. No marked change is observed with once daily milking whereas this would be increased with feed restriction and in contrast, depressed with fasting.'>, <Ref doi '10.1051/rnd:2006030'>}\n",

Recognized molecular, cellular and animal models have been developed to detect and study probiotic bacterial strains. These tools may also reveal unexpected probiotic potential in bacterial strains within the tremendous biodiversity present in traditional fermented products. In our team, we focused on dairy propionibacteria, taking advantage of a unique biological resource center. Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a beneficial bacterium used in the food industry as a vitamin producer, as a bio-preservative and as a cheese ripening starter. We hypothesized that strains considered for techno-functional reasons (aroma, texture), may also play a beneficial role as probiotics. Food-grade dairy propionibacteria are nutraceutical producers. They release short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), folic acid and cobalamin, which play a role in intestinal physiology. SCFAs induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial death pathway. We investigate the potential of dairy propionibacteria-fermented products to synergize with drugs used in gastric and colorectal cancer. Some strains are known to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and mucus and to modulate important functions of the gut mucosa, including cell proliferation and immune response. Selected strains show promising immunomodulatory properties with an anti-inflammatory protective evidenced effect in vitro and in vivo. We thus developed experimental monoxenic fermented dairy products, exclusively fermented by an anti-inflammatory selected strain of P. freudenreichii. Key surface proteins, involved in its immunomodulatory effects, are expressed within these products. Their consumption exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. These results open new perspectives in the field of prevention and/or treatment of intestinal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory diseases (IBD). The synergy with pro-apoptotic chemotherapy molecules suggests that such a fermented product, or the Propionibacterium alone, may be proposed as a food supplement to enhance the effects of anticancer treatments. The preventive effect in the context of induced colitis suggests that it could potentialize IBD treatment. This work reveals an unexpected probiotic potential in industrial dairy propionibacteria starters. It opens exciting perspectives in a context of growing occurrence of IBD, multifactor diseases related to diet, and provides a new functional fermented product for preclinical and clinical studies aimed at prevention or treatment of IBD.'>}\n",

We investigate the potential of dairy propionibacteria-fermented products to synergize with drugs used in gastric and colorectal cancer. Some strains are known to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and mucus and to modulate important functions of the gut mucosa, including cell proliferation and immune response. Selected strains show promising immunomodulatory properties with an anti-inflammatory protective evidenced effect in vitro and in vivo. We thus developed experimental monoxenic fermented dairy products, exclusively fermented by an anti-inflammatory selected strain of P. freudenreichii. Key surface proteins, involved in its immunomodulatory effects, are expressed within these products. Their consumption exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. These results open new perspectives in the field of prevention and/or treatment of intestinal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory diseases (IBD). The synergy with pro-apoptotic chemotherapy molecules suggests that such a fermented product, or the Propionibacterium alone, may be proposed as a food supplement to enhance the effects of anticancer treatments. The preventive effect in the context of induced colitis suggests that it could potentialize IBD treatment. This work reveals an unexpected probiotic potential in industrial dairy propionibacteria starters. It opens exciting perspectives in a context of growing occurrence of IBD, multifactor diseases related to diet, and provides a new functional fermented product for preclinical and clinical studies aimed at prevention or treatment of IBD.'>}\n",

The congruence on propositions is handled via rewrite rules and equational axioms. Rewrite rules apply to terms but also directly to atomic propositions. The second contribution is to give a complete proof search method, called Extended Narrowing and Resolution (ENAR), for theorem proving modulo such congruences. The completeness of this method is proved with respect to provability in sequent calculus modulo. An important application is that higher-order logic can be presented as a theory in deduction modulo.

There is currently considerable interest in developing novel ligands that can modulate the conformations of these co-receptors and, hence, ultimately block virus-cell fusion. This article describes a detailed comparison of the performance of receptor-based and ligand-based virtual screening approaches to find CXCR4 and CCR5 antagonists that could potentially serve as HIV entry inhibitors. Because no crystal structures for these proteins are available, homology models of CXCR4 and CCR5 have been built, using bovine rhodopsin as the template. For ligand-based virtual screening, several shape-based and property-based molecular comparison approaches have been compared, using high-affinity ligands as query molecules. These methods were compared by virtually screening a library assembled by us, consisting of 602 known CXCR4 and CCR5 inhibitors and some 4700 similar presumed inactive molecules. For each receptor, the library was queried using known binders, and the enrichment factors and diversity of the resulting virtual hit lists were analyzed. Overall, ligand-based shape-matching searches yielded higher enrichments than receptor-based docking, especially for CXCR4. The results obtained for CCR5 suggest the possibility that different active scaffolds bind in different ways within the CCR5 pocket.'>}\n",

Here, we demonstrate self-organization of N into NC-like particles in vitro upon addition of RNA, providing a simple and versatile tool for investigating assembly. Real-time NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy reveals biphasic assembly kinetics. Remarkably, assembly depends strongly on the RNA-sequence, with the genomic 5' end and poly-Adenine sequences assembling efficiently, while sequences such as poly-Uracil are incompetent for NC formation.

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract \"Myzus persicae (Sulzer, 1776), a major crop pest worldwide, displays insecticide resistance to most molecules. The R81T substitution on the β1 subunit of nicotinic receptors of acetylcholine (nAChR) confers target site resistance to neonicotinoids and is widespread in aphid populations colonizing peach tree orchards in Southern Europe. But the impact of this resistance in the field, as well as ways to optimize its management, depends largely on the dominance level of the R81T mutation. In this study, we measured by in vitro assays the response of R81T mutation to two neonicotinoids (imidacloprid and thiacloprid) in 23 M. persicae clones with different resistance genotypes in order to assess the dominance status of this allele. In this study, all homozygous clones for the R81T mutation (genotype 81(TT)) showed a much higher level of resistance to both active substances than other clones. The heterozygous clones 81(RT) displayed a slightly higher level of resistance than wild homozygous, though resistance phenotypes against both neonicotinoids in these two genotypes were overlapping. A great variation of resistance level was found within these two latter clones' categories. The dominance level of insecticide resistance (DLC) strongly suggested that the mutant allele 81T is semirecessive (the wild 81R allele being rather dominant) for both insecticide molecules under test. Mean DLC values were 0.316 for imidacloprid and 0.351 for thiacloprid. Cross-resistance was shown between imidacloprid and thiacloprid. This partial recessivity is valuable information to broaden the knowledge on neonicotinoid resistance, a prerequisite for devising adapted management strategies against insecticide-resistant populations of M. persicae.\">, <Ref doi '10.1093/jee/tow148'>, <Ref pubmed '27498842'>}\n",

To address this issue, we sampled six populations of the cereal aphid Sitobion avenae from areas north and south of the Qinling Mountains, and characterized their molecular variation at seven microsatellite loci and quantitative variation at nine life-history traits. Our results demonstrated that southern populations had slightly longer developmental times of nymphs but much higher lifetime fecundity, compared to northern populations. Of the nine tested quantitative characters, eight differed significantly among populations within regions, as well as between northern and southern regions. Genetic differentiation in neutral markers was likely to have been caused by founder events and drift. Increased subdivision for quantitative characters was found in northern populations, but reduced in southern populations. This phenomenon was not found for molecular characters, suggesting the decoupling between molecular and quantitative variation. The pattern of relationships between FST and QST indicated divergent selection and suggested that local adaptation play a role in the differentiation of life-history traits in tested S. avenae populations, particularly in those traits closely related to reproduction. The main role of natural selection over genetic drift was also supported by strong structural differences in G-matrices among S. avenae populations. However, cluster analyses did not result in two groups corresponding to northern and southern regions. Genetic differentiation between northern and southern populations in neutral markers was low, indicating considerable gene flow between them. The relationship between molecular and quantitative variation, as well as its implications for differentiation and evolution of S. avenae populations, was discussed.'>}\n",

We reveal that current vision of engineering design, and particularly FMEA procedure, is based on problem solving perspective, which is restricted by the “bounded-rationality” model. From the concept of “expandable rationality” we propose to revisit the theoretical framework of the FMEA to explain why FMEA cannot be reduced to problem solving. Finally, we argue that FMEA procedure is a full design activity and we propose to extend the initial FMEA methodology, by using CK design theory. The research was carried out in STMicroelectronics manufacturing department, more specifically in the Engineering Competences Center located in Crolles (France).'>}\n",

The existing geodesically linked active contour (GLAC) model, which basically consists of a set of vertices connected by paths of minimal cost, blends the benefits of minimal paths and region-based active contours. This results in a closed piecewise-smooth curve, over which an edge or region energy functional can be formulated. As an important shortcoming, the GLAC in its initial formulation does not guarantee the curve to be simple, consistent with respect to the purpose of segmentation. In this paper, we draw our inspiration from the GLAC and other boundary-based interactive segmentation algorithms, in the sense that we aim to extract a contour given a set of user-provided points, by connecting these points using paths. The key idea is to select a combination among a set of possible paths, such that the resulting structure represents a relevant closed curve. Instead of considering minimal paths only, we switch to a more general formulation, which we refer to as admissible paths. These basically correspond to the roads travelling along the bottom of distinct valleys between given endpoints. We introduce a novel term to favor the simplicity of the generated contour, as well as a local search method to choose the best combination among possible paths.'>}\n"

By harnessing the unique properties of quantum mechanics to code, transmit and process information (Qbit), QIS offers significant opportunities to revolutionise information processing and communication strategies. Of the various physical systems currently investigated, single particles of light (photons) are destined to play a central role due to their inherent low noise, ease of manipulation at the single photon level and light-speed transmission. Photonics Qbits can be conveniently generated through the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion, whereby a photon from a laser beam incident onto a non-linear crystal can spontaneously split into two daughter photons, conserving momentum and energy. Our approach aims at exploiting the high-maturity of both telecom and integrated non-linear optics as enabling technologies. This should lead to the demonstration of ultrafast photon-pair sources, as well as, when one of the photon is used as a trigger, of ultrafastest heralded Fourier transform single photon sources, all in a guided-wave fashion. In this talk, we will present a photon pair source, based on high-brightness periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide, pumped by a state-of-the-art telecom laser operating at a repetition rate of 10 GHz. We will also show how high quality telecommunication components enable the implementation of an ultrafast Fourier transform limited heralded single-photon source complying with the demand of next generation high bit rates quantum networks.'>}\n",

This discrete-event simulator is stochastic and individually based. It integrates a detailed reproduction model together with parameter-settable practices. This article details the various core components of the simulator. We then used it on virtual experiments with a herd of 70 cows. The first virtual experiment compared an autumn calving system with a herd management system based on winter calving. Adapting the herd management rules made it possible for the two systems to give similar outputs. In order to show the importance of the number of mated cows and of the reproductive period length on the performance of the herd, two different strategies were tested in with two new virtual experiments. The first one consisted in reducing the number of mated cows while the second one deals with reducing the reproduction period when the bull is present. The first of these scenarios led to drop in herd size in proportion with the female reduction over the years, whereas under the second scenario, a gap is simulated and the herd was wiped out after 10 years. We also focused an in-depth analysis on the variability of the results. The model shows that an average result not only masks variations from replication to replication but also masks variations in performances from year to year.'>}\n",

The cave has been closed according to the collapse of its entrance, at the end of the Bronze Age. The study in progress takes place in a new kind of tool founded by the Institute of Ecology and Environment (INEE): sites dedicated to the study of global ecology. In that framework, we try to develop new methods of data acquiring, according to an interdisciplinary way. A partnership among archaeologists and surveyors from INSA allow the 3D recording and modelling of the global volume cave. In the same time, we implement the high resolution acquiring of parietal representations (engravings and fingerings). The aim of this paper is focusing on the complementarity of data which are produced by the different scales of 3D recording used in the cave. Another purpose is to issue a statement of the different 3D technologies tested in \"Les Fraux\".

This process depends on several ligands and modulators, one of which unexpectedly includes the serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). In vitro, tPA increases NMDA-receptor-mediated calcium influx by interacting with, and then cleaving, the NR1 subunit within its N-terminal domain. Owing to lack of in vivo evidence of the relevance and contribution of this mechanism in physiological and pathological brain processes, active immunisation was developed here in mice, to allow transient and specific prevention of the interaction of tPA with the NR1 subunit. Immunisation significantly reduced the severity of ischemic and excitotoxic insults in the mouse brain. Cognitive function was altered in some, but not all behavioural tasks affected in tPA-deficient mice. Our data demonstrate that in vivo, tPA controls neurotoxicity and the encoding of novel spatial experiences by binding to and cleaving the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit. Interesting therapeutic possibilities for several brain pathologies that involve excitotoxicity may now be envisaged.'>}\n",

Even though those devices keep improving, the failure rate of the endovascular treatment is due to persisting pressure into the excluded aneurysmal sac. Since 2005, several integrated sensors have been designed for the follow-up of the AAA treated by a stent. Solutions are based on the use of a single sensor. Thrombus in the excluded AAA can modify the field of pressure when leaks appeared and a network of sensors should be used. We present in this paper the ENDOCOM project that aims to design an implantable pressure sensor that can be used in a network configuration. To validate the new materials, we developed a framework composed of in vitro experiments and in vivo tests on large animal model.

By contrast, Foxl2 loss of function in mice induces an arrest of follicle formation after birth, followed by complete female sterility. In order to understand the molecular role of FOXL2 during ovarian differentiation in the goat species, putative FOXL2 target genes were determined at the earliest stage of gonadal sex-specific differentiation by comparing the mRNA profiles of XX gonads expressing the FOXL2 protein or not. Of these 163 deregulated genes, around two-thirds corresponded to testicular genes that were up-regulated when FOXL2 was absent, and only 19 represented female-associated genes, down-regulated in the absence of FOXL2. FOXL2 should therefore be viewed as an antitestis gene rather than as a female-promoting gene. In particular, the key testis-determining gene DMRT1 was found to be up-regulated ahead of SOX9, thus suggesting in goats that SOX9 primary up-regulation may require DMRT1. Overall, our results equated to FOXL2 being an antitestis gene, allowing us to propose an alternative model for the sex-determination process in goats that differs slightly from that demonstrated in mice.'>}\n",

This measurement relies on the reconstruction of soft momenta, impacted by the SuperKEKB induced background. Two PLUME ladders will be used to study this background, therefore a study on the performances of PLUME was performed. The spatial resolution is of 1.8 µm and 3.5 µm for 0° and 36° tilted tracks respectivelly. We also propose to improve the estimation of soft momenta using the energy depositions of charged particles in the silicon layers of the inner tracker.

Nous montrons que cette mesure est limitée statistiquement, avec une incertitude totale attendue de l'ordre de 3°. La mesure de βc nécessite la reconstruction de trajectoires de particules de très faible impulsion, impactée par le bruit de fond induit par SuperKEKB. Deux échelles PLUME vont être utilisées pour étudier ce bruit de fond. Ici, une étude des performances de PLUME est effectuée. Ainsi, la résolution spatiale avec des traces à 0° et 36° est mesurée, de 1,8 µm et 3,5µm respectivement. Par ailleurs nous proposons d'améliorer la mesure des faibles impulsions en utilisant la charge déposée par la particule dans le trajectomètre interne au silicium.

The literature is quite poor on this and the few existing definitions do not take into account these aspects. In particular, an object B that is in a concavity of an object A1 not visible from an object A2 is considered between A1 and A2 for most definitions, which is counter intuitive. Also, none of the definitions deal with cases where one object is much more elongated than the other. Here, we propose definitions which are based on convexity, morphological operators, and separation tools, and a fuzzy notion of visibility. They correspond to the main intuitive exceptions of the relation. We distinguish between cases where objects have similar spatial extensions and cases where one object is much more extended than the other. Extensions to cases where objects, themselves, are fuzzy and to three-dimensional space are proposed as well. The original work proposed in this paper covers the main classes of situations and overcomes the limits of existing approaches, particularly concerning nonvisible concavities and extended objects. Moreover, the definitions capture the intrinsic imprecision attached to this relation. The main proposed definitions are illustrated on real data from medical images.'>}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref fr_abstract 'Internet est devenu un vecteur important de la communication. Il permet la diffusion et l\\'échange d\\'un volume croissant de données. Il ne s\\'agit donc plus seulement de collecter des masses importantes \" d\\'informations électroniques \", mais surtout de les répertorier, de les classer pour faciliter l\\'accès à l\\'information utile. Une information, aussi importante soit-elle, sur un site non répertorié, est méconnue. Il ne faut donc pas négliger la part du \" Web invisible \". Le Web invisible peut se définir comme l\\'ensemble des informations non indexées, soit parce qu\\'elles ne sont pas répertoriées, soit parce que les pages les contenant sont dynamiques, soit encore parce que leur nature n\\'est pas ou difficilement indexable. En effet, la plupart des moteurs de recherche se basent sur une analyse textuelle du contenu des pages, mais ne peuvent prendre en compte le contenu des documents sonores ou visuels. Il faut donc fournir un ensemble d\\'éléments descripteurs du contenu pour structurer les documents afin que l\\'information soit accessible aux moteurs de recherche. S\\'agissant de documents sonores, le but de notre projet est donc, d\\'une part, d\\'extraire ces informations et, d\\'autre part, de fournir une structuration des documents afin de faciliter l\\'accès au contenu. L\\'indexation par le contenu de documents sonores s\\'appuie sur des techniques utilisées en traitement automatique de la parole, mais doit être distinguée de l\\'alignement automatique d\\'un texte sur un flux sonore ou encore de la reconnaissance automatique de la parole. Ce serait alors réduire le contenu d\\'un document sonore à sa seule composante verbale. Or, la composante non-verbale d\\'un document sonore est importante et correspond souvent à une structuration particulière du document. Par exemple, dans le cas de documents radiophoniques, on voit l\\'alternance de parole et de musique, plus particulièrement de jingles, pour annoncer les informations. Ainsi, nous pouvons considérer un ensemble de descripteurs du contenu d\\'un document radiophonique : segments de Parole/Musique, \" sons clés \", langue, changements de locuteurs associés à une éventuelle identification de ces locuteurs, mots clés et thèmes. Cet ensemble peut être bien entendu enrichi. Extraire l\\'ensemble des descripteurs est sans doute suffisant pour référencer un document sur Internet. Mais il est intéressant d\\'aller plus loin et de donner accès à des parties précises du document. Chaque descripteur doit être associé à un marqueur temporel qui donne accès directement à l\\'information. Cependant, l\\'ensemble des descripteurs appartenant à des niveaux de description différents, leur organisation n\\'est pas linéaire dans le temps : un même locuteur peut parler en deux langues sur un même segment de parole, ou encore sur un segment de parole dans une langue donnée, plusieurs locuteurs peuvent intervenir. Il faut donc aussi être capable de fournir une structuration de l\\'information sur différents niveaux de représentation.'>}\n"

To explore this heterogeneity, we performed a genome-wide integrative screening of three molecular levels: genome, transcriptome, and methylome. We analyzed tumor biopsies obtained by neuro-navigation in four distinct areas for 10 GB patients (necrotic zone, tumor zone, interface, and peripheral brain zone). We classified samples and deciphered a key genes signature of intratumor heterogeneity by Principal Component Analysis and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. At the genome level, we identified common GB copy number alterations and but a strong interindividual molecular heterogeneity. Transcriptome analysis highlighted a pronounced intratumor architecture reflecting the surgical sampling plan of the study and identified gene modules associated with hallmarks of cancer. We provide a signature of key cancer-heterogeneity genes highly associated with the intratumor spatial gradient and show that it is enriched in genes with correlation between methylation and expression levels. Our study confirms that GBs are molecularly highly diverse and that a single tumor can harbor different transcriptional GB subtypes depending on its spatial architecture.'>, <Ref pubmed '25940437'>}\n",

      "\ton behalf of: {<Ref en_abstract 'Landscape spatial organization (LSO) strongly impacts many environmental issues. Modelling agricultural landscapes and describing meaningful landscape patterns are thus regarded as key-issues for designing sustainable landscapes. Agricultural landscapes are mostly designed by farmers. Their decisions dealing with crop choices and crop allocation to land can be generic and result in landscape regularities, which determine LSO. This paper comes within the emerging discipline called \"landscape agronomy\", aiming at studying the organization of farming practices at the landscape scale. We here aim at articulating the farm and the landscape scales for landscape modelling. To do so, we develop an original approach consisting in the combination of two methods used separately so far: the identification of explicit farmer decision rules through on-farm surveys methods and the identification of landscape stochastic regularities through data-mining. We applied this approach to the Niort plain landscape in France. Results show that generic farmer decision rules dealing with sunflower or maize area and location within landscapes are consistent with spatiotemporal regularities identified at the landscape scale. It results in a segmentation of the landscape, based on both its spatial and temporal organization and partly explained by generic farmer decision rules. This consistency between results points out that the two modelling methods aid one another for land-use modelling at landscape scale and for understanding the driving forces of its spatial organization. Despite some remaining challenges, our study in landscape agronomy accounts for both spatial and temporal dimensions of crop allocation: it allows the drawing of new spatial patterns coherent with land-use dynamics at the landscape scale, which improves the links to the scale of ecological processes and therefore contributes to landscape ecology.'>}\n",

This analysis was performed on 17 strains belonging to the B. cereus group and to less related Bacillus species. We first demonstrated that spores of the B. cereus group, surrounded by an exosporium, differed in their morphological features such as exosporium size, number of appendages or hair-like nap length. We also found that the saccharidic composition of exosporium differed among strains, e.g. concerning a newly identified rhamnose derivative: the 2,4-O-dimethyl-rhamnose. Conversely, spores of distant Bacillus species shared morphological and physico-chemical properties with B. cereus spores. Some external features were also observed on these spores, such as a thin loose-fitting layer, whose nature is still to be determined, or a thick saccharidic layer (mainly composed of rhamnose and quinovose). The ability of spores to adhere to stainless steel varied among strains, those belonging to the B. cereus group generally being the most adherent. However, the presence of an exosporium is not sufficient to explain the ability of spores to adhere to inanimate surfaces. Indeed, when the 17 strains were compared, hydrophobicity and the number of appendages were the only significant adhesion parameters. Furthermore, the differences in spore adhesion observed within the B. cereus group were related to differences in the number of appendages, the exosporium length and to a lesser extent, the zeta potential.'>}\n",

Satisfying customers implies improving Quality and reducing Costs and Lead-time. To stay economically competitive in such a context, it is compulsory to use the production system at the best. Optimising locally the production does not ensure a global performance. That is why we propose in this paper a global modelling of French car manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroën's Supply Chain. Such an approach allows highlighting and evaluating global impacts of local decision-making. Lastly, we will introduce a decision-support tool, dedicated to factories management.\">}\n"
